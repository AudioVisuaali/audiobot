Go save someone else!\"\n\nFrustrated, the helicopter flies away. \n\nSadly, the water becomes too much for the priest to deal with and he goes under.\n\nHe finds himself in heaven, absolutely stunned. After going through the pearly gates, he walks straight up to God himself.\n\n\"Lord,\" the priest says, \"I spent my life devoted to you. I truly believed that you would protect me through the hardest times in my life. Yet when I needed you most, when my life was at stake, you weren't there for me!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" God replies. \"I sent two boats and a fucking helicopter!!\"\n",

The entire process took no more than twenty minutes. \n\nJoe left town and drove for a couple hours before exiting the highway and driving down a winding county road for another ten minutes. Joe pulled into a service station and parked his car. He sat in his vehicle, loaded five shells into his new Benelli shotgun, and chambered in a shell.\n\nJoe clicked off the safety and walked into the convenience store. There was no one in sight but the attendant behind the counter. Her name was Janice. She tried to run when she saw the shotgun but Joe shot her as she turned. She took some buckshot to the brain and died almost instantly.\n\nJoe walked behind the counter, stepping carefully over Janice, picked up the phone, and dialed 911. \"I've killed a lady. I'm robbing the store,\" Joe told the 911 operator. He then emptied the cash register, walked out to his vehicle, and drove away. \n\nA short ways down the road, Joe came upon another service station. He pulled in and exited his vehicle. The owner of the service station was a capable man named Bill. Bill saw the look in Joe's eyes when Joe approached the door of the service station, and he saw the gun in his hand. Bill was ready with his own shotgun by the time Joe raised his, and Bill pumped a slug into Joe's abdomen.\n\nBill immediately called for an ambulance and approached Joe with compassion. \"Let me help you, son.\"\n\nAs Bill tended to Joe's wounds as best as he could, it became clear that Joe might not survive. Bill asked him, \"Why did you do it, son? Why did you bring that damn gun into my store? I had to shoot you. What, were you going to rob me? Why?\"\n\nAs the light of life flickered in Joe's eyes, with his dying breath he responded, \"Damn it all. Shamu and Moby Dick put me up to it. They are waiting outside for me right now. I'm gonna go get them. Be right back, mister.\"\n\nAnd with that, Joe died. Bill would go on to give a full account of Joe's actions and his last words to the police and to the press. Then, the following morning, the Sunday paper headline read,\n\n\"The Outlaw Joe Sees Whales\"",

They are also the ones that people will trim to prevent birds from flying away. Crows have 5 pinion feathers while ravens have 6. So, if you think about it, it's really just a matter of a pinion.\" \n\nTo this day, my friend and her family don't know the real answer to \"What's the difference between a crow and a raven?\"  ",

He was aware of that most french people don't speak english so he ordered a french lesson for one day to learn the necessities when going to a new country. The day for the lesson came, but when he arrived at the school, it seemed quite empty. He went in saw a guy sitting behind a counter. \"Hi, I came for the french lesson today\" our guy said. \"Oh, I'm sorry. The French teacher is ill and will be home for a week.\" \"So there is no one that know any french here?\" \"No I'm sorry. But I have a little note I can give you. Just show it when you order something, or don't know what to say, and it should work out fine\" \"Uhm ok. What does it say?\" \"I'm sorry, I don't know, really. The french teacher just told me to give it to people while he was gone.\" Our guy thought that was fair enough. He didn't have time to order a new lesson anyway.\n\nThe day for the journey came. With a packed bag he went to the airport and flew all the way to France. He arrived in France in the evening and went out to grab a cab. A cab arrived and after greeting the French cab driver he figured he could use the note and see if the driver would understand what it said. He showed the note. The driver looked at the note, then at our guy, then at the note, and back at the guy, before he cursed in french and drove off. \"Well that's weird. Maybe the note isn't ment for cab drivers\" he thought and walked until he found a bus. He went on the bus and thought he'd give the note another try. The bus driver looked at the note and went red in an instant. He commanded our guy off the bus, and drove away. This annoyed our guy a little. He waited for another bus and did not show the note this time. He said the name of his hotel, the bus driver nodded, he paid and sat down next to a lady. She asked him in french if he was american and he said yes. She seemed to understand a little english, so he thought she could translate the note. He asked if she could and she nodded. He pulled out the note and showed it to her. She read it and quickly shoved it away from her in anger, and she called for the bus driver. Our guy understood what they wanted and stood the rest of the ride in frustration. He finally arrived at his hotel tired of being yelled at and ready to sleep. At the receptions desk he told his name, they wrote something down and asked him for ID. When finding his ID the note accidentally fell out of his pocket and onto the counter. The receptionist read it and as he expected, got really mad. Another guy that worked there came and they talked for a while, before accepting that our guy could sleep there, but they weren't happy about it. \n\"That's it. I've had enough of this, tomorrow I'm going back home!\" our guy thought, and so he did.\n\nLuckily this was easier. He did not show the note to anyone and mimed his way back to America. He stayed home for a week before deciding to go back to the french school, now that the teacher was back, and find out what the note said. At the school he met the teacher and asked quite annoyed what the note said. \"Let me see\" the teacher said putting on his glasses. Our guy handed him the note. At this time two windows were open. A gust of wind blew the note out of their hands and out one of the windows, and they never found it. Neither did our guy find out what the note said... Not even I know... Sorry\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These paved roads appeared well-worn, but it was unfamiliar!  There were barbed wire fences on both sides of this two lane road and random horses and cows.    \n\nThen, suddenly, there was a blur that burst past the side of our car.\n\nWhat was that?!  We both uttered these words, simultaneously.    We decided to find out.   \n\nI was driving 60mph, so I sped up to 70mph.   I was gaining on the blur, but it was clear I needed to go faster if I had any hope to identify this freakishly speedy blur.\n\nI accelerated to 80mph but it seemed to be moving much faster.   Just as I exceeded 90mph I realized I\u2019d never match it\u2019s speed.  But suddenly the blur made a right turn onto an humble dirt road.  \n\nI screeched to a halt.  My buddy said, \u2018you gotta turn around and try to see what that thing was!!\u2019  I was curious, as well, so that\u2019s precisely what I did.\n\nI cautiously proceeded down this dirt road and it was less than 1/2mile when we noticed a broken down wooden shack of a home.   On the porch were three folks in rocking chairs.  I parked my car and stepped out, politely announcing my name and asking if these folks had seen this blur that had us so perplexed!\n\n\u201cOh, yeah\u201d, responded the old lady.   \u201cThat was one of our three legged chickens.\u201d\n\nMy buddy reacted, \u201cthree legged chickens?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cwell, me, Paw and Jr. all LOVE chicken legs.  It was Jr\u2019s idea.   He said we needed to raise three legged chickens!  And that\u2019s what we did!  That blur---you seen one of em!\u2019  \n\nJr\u2019s beeming  pride was obvious as he smiled a smile so incredible it exposed his dozen remaining teeth!!  The American Dental Association would have been bewildered, speechless!\n\n\u201cSounds like a great idea!\u201d, I said.  I continued, \u201cSo\u2026..how do they taste?\u201d\n\nJr\u2019s smile evaporated as Maw responded, \u201cdon\u2019t know.   Can\u2019t catch \u2018em.\u201d\n",

Afterwards there was a celebration for the Torero (Bullfighter) and the crowd slowly dispersed, with the man leaving among the last of them so that he could savor the experience. \n\nOnce he'd exited the arena, he noticed large groups from the group gathering at a restaurant across the street. Hungry, the man followed as well and decided to experience the native cuisine. \n\nAs the night progressed, he had joined a few others at a table and began chatting with them joyously about the match. Until he noticed that at one table a very wealthy looking man had been made the center of attention by the restaurants staff as the chef personally brought out a special silver plate with strange meat on them.\n\nCurious, the man asked his new friends what was so special about that man. One of the men at his table explained that the man was a foreigner, much like him, who has payed handsomely for the privilege of eating the spirit of the bull which died in the arena. Which according to them was symbolically located in the testicles of the powerful animal. \n\nObviously amazed by the ritual, he noticed how excited & happy the man was. Being quite wealthy himself, he asked if there was any way for him to pay for the same honor. After a short talk with the restaurants owner, he came to an agreement and reserved a plate for tomorrow.\n\nThough he didn't get a chance to watch the bullfights that day, he had anxiously been waiting since the previous night for this moment. And now that he was at the restaurant he couldn't help but rush to his table and wait for his meal.\n\nAfter a few moments, the staff gathered and the chef brought out the same plate as the previous night, except that there was noticeably less meat on it this time.\n\nConfused, the man asked the chef if the bull had been smaller than the one from yesterday.\n\nThe chef merely replied that the bull is quite large, alive, and in good health, it was the Torero who lost today.

After getting to America they settled down and tried to start a family.

The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. \n\nMODERN VERSION: \n\nThe ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. \n\nCome winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. \n\nCBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? \n\nThen a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with \"green bias,\" and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism. \n\nKermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the \"Temperatures of the 80's.\"\n\nRichard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his \"fair share.\" Finally, the EEOC drafts the \"Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act\" retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government. \n\nHillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled. \n\nThe ant loses the case. \n\nThe story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it. \n\nThe ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of politicians announcing that a new era of \"fairness\" has dawned in America.

Floored, he can't respond before the grasshopper leaves.\nHe decides he'd better be in better shape, so the next day he only gets one six pack. Just as he's finishing the last beer, he hears another knock at the door. He gets up to answer it, a bit more wary this time. Not that it does him any good. The six foot tall grasshopper is there again, and this time hits him twice, each one as hard as he's ever been hit! Again, the grasshopper leaves before he can do anything.\nOn the third day, he decides he'd better just skip his beer. He's sitting in his living room, stone cold sober, when he hears a knock at the door. He checks his peephole. It's the grasshopper. But he figures this time he hasn't been drinking and he can take him, so he opens the door. Before he can do anything, the grasshopper knocks him down and kicks him until he can't move. Again, the grasshopper leaves when it's done.\nObviously he's in bad shape after that, so he goes in to see his doctor. He describes what's been going on. The doctor nods knowingly, \"Yeah, there's been a pretty nasty bug going around.\"",

I lives with my parents!\" he thought to himself:\"but how did this guy know? Do I know this guy?\" He then did a quick brain search, but couldn't think of a single Asian guy he knew. So he maintained his composure, and replied calmly: \"Sir, I'm sure you mistook me for someone else.

He searched through his mind once more. Nope, couldn't think of any Asian guy he had ever made acquaintance under any circumstance. Probably just some random drunk. So he replied: \"Look, I don't know who you are but you better leave me alone. My father is a lawyer, not a teacher.\"\n\nSoon an African guy walked in and sat on his left.

        "body": "God says \"Satan, you've betrayed me before, but I am a just and forgiving god. You may get back into Heaven, if you can beat my only son in a programming contest.\"\n\nSatan and Jesus meet to agree to the terms. The contest is a simple one. God will set a timer for six hours, and both Jesus and Satan will sit down at their desktops and pound out as much perfectly-formatted HTML as they possibly can. The contest is officially scheduled for Easter Sunday, and news spreads far and wide. \n\nEaster Sunday rolls around. People from all over flock to Heaven to witness the contest. It is broadcasted live on several news stations, and is even live-tweeted by some representatives from Google. At exactly 8:59 AM, Satan and Jesus both sit down at two computers, facing each other. They log in and open up their scripting program. At 9 AM, Archangel Michael drops a flag and the race begins. \n\nOne hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it's a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead. \n\nBy 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus. \n\nBy noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately. \n\nAt 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming. \n\nBy 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can't be perfectly formatted. \n\n2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces \"JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!\" \n\nSatan is furious. \"How can this be?\" He asks. \"I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!\"\n\nJesus taunts Satan. \"Well I don't see your code, Satan.

Being an avid cosplayer, Nicholas, who we called Nick, was going as the iron giants. I'm more inclined to go with a simple costume, as I have in the past. I went as a roll of toilet paper. Warren, who we called War because it sounds better than 'Ren,' could not for the life of him choose what to wear.\n\nSo we went to the costume store and looked at every single outfit we could. He decided to pick out a ninja turtle outfit. Well, our friend Catherine, who we called Kate, was there and she was also going to be a ninja turtle. She became a bit upset at the thought of wearing the same thing as War. \n\n\"Look,\" Kate told Nick, \" I know that if it were you that picked out the same costume as me, you'd change it. Same to you,\" she told me. \"You guys are reasonable like that. But War. War never changes.\" \n",

The man then drinks both of the beverages.\n\n\nThe man then spots a good friend across the bar, and notices that his friend is with a woman that looked nothing like the friend's wife. The man confronts his friend when he is alone, and the friend says\n\n\n\"Actually, that's my sister. She's visiting town from Pittsburgh.\"\n\n\nThe friend then pulls out his phone and proves this with some family photos and their last few text conversations. The man, realizing he misunderstood the situation, apologizes to his friend and his sibling and walks out of the bar, wishing both of them a good night.\n\n\nThe man walks down the street when he watches two people dressed as apes, three women dressed as clowns, and two kids in a tandem horse costume. The man knows it is Halloween, so this succession of people doesn't phase him or anyone else on the sidewalk.\n\n\nThe man reaches his house and, noting that the lights are off, quietly unlocks the door so as to not wake up his sleeping wife. He slowly tiptoes his way up the stairs when he misses a step and stumbles down three stairs. This wakes up his wife, and she walks out of their bedroom and says\n\n\n\"Are you okay sweetie?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" the man says, \"I just stumbled a bit. Sorry I'm late, I ran across Jim at the bar and we had a chat.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's alright, honey. Just get to bed soon, okay? I need you to get Billy to his friend's birthday party tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\"Okay, sweetest.\" Said the man. He doesn't really want to do it, since it means he has to talk with the other kids' parents while he's there, and the man isn't very good at small talk.\n\n\n\nBut he loves his son, so he will do it anyway.

The son explained the situation to the lady and told her that even though he has no money, he does have this duck. The woman thinks for a while, and decides to take the duck as payment since she knew a guy that could help her prepare the duck so that she could cook it for dinner.\n\nSo after they have sex, the woman is flabbergasted at just how magnificent the son was in bed. She even offered him a freebie but being the polite guy that he is, he refused. So the woman, desperate for another round, offered the duck back as payment, the son agrees and so they have sex again. \nLater, the son leaves the brothel with the duck. On their way back home a truck appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and hits the duck, killing it. Feeling bad, the driver offers to pay the son for the duck. Not knowing how much it was worth the son settles for $20. The driver happily obliges, pays him the $20, and they both go on their ways.\n\nFinally the son gets home when his dad asks him \"So son, how was it?\" The son replies \"I dunno dad, you tell me.\" \"Ok, so tell me what happened\" replied the dad. The son replied \"Well dad, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 20 bucks for a fucked up duck.\"",

        "body": "I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.\n\nNo, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans (look it up) were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.\n\nI was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. \"Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!\" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. \"How many Indians could there be?\" said by General Custer. \"Looks like a good day for a drive!\" by JFK. \"There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!\" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.\n\nI performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.\n\nLittle did I know.\n\nI now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.\n\nUnfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit-molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.\n\nUnfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: \"It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.\"\n\nLater on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.\n\nFriends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!",

        "body": "Dave the Catholic Priest needed a part time job. His salary was still quite low and he needed to save up while on vacation. So he got in contact with Francis, the Bishop, to get help in spreading word around local businesses that Dave was a good, honest chap ready to undertake work.\n\n  In no time at all Dave got a break- fast food. \n\n  He showed up at 7 am for the first day. Jim, an old friend of Francis the Bishop, was sympathetic to Dave's cause and was happy in giving him a dozen hours a week. He was also aware of Dave's one flaw that Francis warned him about: Dave tended to daydream and become forgetful, aloof or even careless during monotonous tasks. This had led to him losing the Church keys on a few occasions. Leading Choir practice in the driving rain was not a pleasant experience.\n\n So Jim was on the lookout and intended to keep a keen eye on Dave's performance. \n\n  \"Dave mate. I haven't trained you in food safety yet. So for this week you're responsible for keeping the joint clean before, during, and after the chippy is open for service. Right. Any questions? Good man,\"\n\n  So Dave was handed reign of all cleaning supplies and tasks. Days 1 and 2 went okay. Dave just about managed to prep the front of shop for the opening, though struggled keeping count of all the bits and bobs in inventory. Day 3 was a struggle. Dave, used to working in leisurely pace found wiping down tables and clearing trash in time quite taxing. More than once he left spray bottles around benches and behind doors. Customers were befuddled and Jim left frustrated at this incompetence.\n\n  Jim stopped Dave on the morning of day 4. Trash was found under tables, counters left too greasy after ineffective wiping, and the supplies were whittled away almost to nothing but a sponge after Dave's mismanagement.\n\n  \"Jim, look I'm really sorry. But I'm getting the hang of this now! Please give me another role if you really don't me cleaning.\"\n\n  So Jim complied. The next day Dave turned up at 6.30 am as per instruction.\n\n  \"Okay Dave. Fresh start. This job is a bit new and I'm sure you'll learn from it too. You need to collect the frozen supplies at the store. They've been paid for so don't worry. Just collect everything and race back in good time. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n  Dave thought he knew exactly what Jim meant. \n\n  \"So long as I drive quickly, I can take the rest of the day off!\"\n\n  Two hours later on what should have been a 15 minute trip, Dave entered the premises with a dejected expression.\n\n  Ten minutes later Jim also wore the same expression, albeit with a scowl and high blood pressure to match; Dave had struck a streetlamp, mounted the sidewalk and blown out a tire in the process because he thought Jim wanted him to *race* back. With the company car out of service Jim was strained to keep things operational. Dave was becoming a liability.\n\n  To the sheepish priest he said, \"Dave. Final chance. I hired you as a favor, not a burden. From tomorrow work in the back with Phil on food. He'll give you something to do.\"\n\n  Dave nodded vigorously, \"Thank you so much Jim! I swear to it- I won't be forgetful or careless. You can count on me!\"\n\n  \"Yeah. Good. Just don't burn this place down.\"\n\n  6.30 am, the next day. Dozens of customers filed in and out every few hours, bellies filled, vinegary lips smacked. Jim didn't see much of Dave. Naturally he was quite nervous. No complaints over the phone for mixed up orders, or hair in the mayo, or dismembered digits in the salad. Maybe he should have put Dave there in the first place. The next day came and went. Another suspiciously uneventful day. Almost too quiet. \"Don't fret too much\", Jim thought to himself later on that Thursday evening. \"Phil was happy with Dave's work and didn't mention any hiccups.\"\n\n  A week passed in this way. Jim was in a good mood to say the least. Sales and profit had nearly increased by 500%; customers were actually leaving feedback on their experience for the first time in months; The company car was back from repairs, costs much lower than anticipated; the takeaway was still not destroyed in a fire, and Phil reported no missing items or mishap in the kitchen. Even Dave was in a good mood, starting and leaving his shifts with a smile on his face and lively spring in his step, giving him an almost surreptitious look.  \n\n  It was nearing the end of Dave's vacation. Jim had just handed the last overtime paycheck to his star employee when he thought to ask something on his mind for a while now, \"Dave, top job. You've done wonders to help this takeaway get back on its feet again. Everyone loves the food. Heck, even people from the next town over are calling in to order! So between us two men- how on earth do you cook so well? The battered fish is the talk of the town, so are the chicken wings- oh and the chips! They're so good they make you want to slap your mama! How have you done it!?\"\n\n  \"It's nothing, really Jim!\"\n\n  \"No, no! Please tell! You're one of us. Even if you're leaving, you can pop around to help any time you want at double your current wages. But please. How have you done it?\"\n\n  \"It's simple, Jim,\" Dave said as he moved to lean forward, closing the gap between his boss. Involuntarily, an excited croak left Jim's throat.\n\n  \"Oh?\" sweat beaded on his forehead.\n\n   \"Simple, Jim. I'm just a good friar.\"",

One night they decided to take a break and go visit the circus that just pulled into the vineyard.  \n  \nThe circus was amazing and they enjoyed a peaceful night not worrying about babies, as they were leaving they noticed a small tent off to the side and they entered it. An old wrinkly prune sat in front of a table and spoke to them \"I know what you seek, a child to call your own, I can help you but it comes at a price.\" \"Anything\" Mrs Grape replied \"we have money, antiques, anything!\" \"No, no, no, drink this potion, in 6 nights you will give birth. He will not be handsome, he will not be timid, if you can not love him, you will return to us and he will live here in the circus, yes?\" The prune asked as she handed a small bottle to Mrs Grape. Knowing she would love him no matter what he was like, Mrs Grape drank the potion.  \n \nTrue to the prunes word Mrs Grape fell pregnant, six nights later she gave birth, he was small, very dry, brown and shrivelled. Mr & Mrs Grape tried to care for the little boy, they nurtured him, stayed awake with him, gave him everything they had but he never stopped crying and once he could move he never stopped trying to destroy their house. After several weeks they were exhausted. The little one never grew, he stayed dry, small and wrinkly, the stress was becoming too much.  \n  \nOne day Mr Grape returned from work with a small cage, he convinced Mrs Grape they needed a nights sleep and to decide in the morning if they would return the child to the circus. They locked him in the cage and moved him to the furthest part of the vineyard. For the first time in weeks they held each other and slept. In the morning with a fresh outlook they knew something was not right with their child, they walked hand in hand to the cage, ready to take him to the Prune.  \n  \nMr Grape spoke sadly \"I'm sorry buddy, we've tried, we are exhausted and I don't even think you understand us?

Just stick your dick in there and you will feel better. The new lumberjack was put off by this idea and decided to pass. But, after a few more weeks he was getting antsy and decided to make the hike to the tree. When he gets there he sticks his dick in and is amazed, it feels just like fucking a woman. He was instantly hooked. He started visiting the tree every night, sometimes more then once and would just go to town fucking the shit out of that tree. One night on one of his trips he sticks his dick in and nothing happens, it feels like just sticking his dick in a wood hole. He goes back to foreman and tells him he thinks the tree is broken. The foreman says, \"that's strange\" he pulls a clipboard off the wall and says, \"oh, no its your turn to be inside the hollow tree.\"",

He is filled with nostalgia and starts feeling better already.\nThey have coffee and chat for a little bit and the executive says he wants to do some farm manual labor to take his head off work and forget about the city life for a while.\nThe farmer says there is plenty of work to do around the farm and the executive can help him. So the farmer tells him to wake up early the next day and meet him at the stable.\nWhen the executive gets to the stable the next day the farmer shows him piles of bags and say:\n- This is all the horse manure we collected for the past 3 months. Your job will will be to spread it over that empty field to fertilize the soil for the next season.\nTwo hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do.\nThe farmer is surprised. \"This usually takes us a whole day! I only planned work for you for tomorrow\".\nSo the farmer inspects the field and is astonished the executive did such a good job in so little time. So he tells him to take the rest of the day off and meet him at he chicken coop the next morning.\nThe next morning the farmer says: \"We got a big chicken order from one of our clients and we have to deliver it ready for processing. Your job will be to cut the chickens head off so we can send them out. Again, two hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do. The farmer is surprised now even more. He didn't think his city cousin could manage farm jobs so well.\n\"This usually takes us two days, this is impressive! Meet me at the orange plantation tomorrow morning.\"\nThe next morning the farmer says: \"The orange harvesting wasn't very good this year. We only got this 10 boxes of oranges. Your job will be to separate them in 3 piles, big oranges, medium oranges and small oranges. If anyone is bad just discard it.\"\nTo the farmers surprise, it's the end of the day and his executive cousin is still not back for dinner, so he goes to check on him. When he gets there is sees his cousin working out still on the first box, comparing sizes on two oranges, then picking a third one and changing it's original pile... The farmer is puzzled, screeching his head. \"what's the matter? I thought you would finish this in no time\"\nThe executive looks at him and says: \"I'm an executive.

I've been listening to them for years.  Most of them don't even know what they're talking about.  I think you could just throw out random numbers and none of them would know it.\"\n\nJust then an elderly gentleman sits next to him.  The guy decides to give it a try, so he looks over and asks, \"So my friend.  Twenty eight.\"\n\nHe replies, \"Twenty eight?  Bah!  A hundred and thirteen.\"\n\n\"Fifty-two.\"\n\n\"Fifty-two?\" The man raises his voice a little.  \"Seventy three!\"\n\nNot knowing what to say next, the man just spouts off random numbers.  \"Eight nine\"\n\n\"Eight\"\n\n\"Ninety six.\"\n\n\"A hundred and four!\"\n\nThe exchange continues back and forth.  Thirty-two.  Fifty Six.  Seventy nine.  One thirty three.  \n\nThe old man stops and with a huge grin, he says \"Ah ... very clever.  Very clever.  One thirty three.  But Sixteen.  You never considered sixteen. Checkmate.\"\n\nThe guy, still clueless about what they just argued about, looks to the bartender, holds up his finger to motion for another drink and says, \"One.\"\n\nAt that moment, the bar goes silent.  They all look to the man.  The elderly gentleman is furious.  Enraged.  He stands up, and with as strong a punch any octogenarian can muster, he hits the guy as hard as he can, and storms out.  \n\nStunned, the guy recomposes himself.  The bar goes back to their conversations, and he asks the bartender, \"What the hell just happened?\"\n\n\"That was Saul Greenberg, and you just said he's no better than Hitler.\"",

        "body": "During the Yongle Emperor's reign in the Ming Dynasty, there was an imperial proclamation posted on the Quintuple Pailou of Front-Gate Street in Beijing. This proclamation gripped the attention of the entire city. The people of the three front gates gathered up like a storm. Monks, Taoists, Muslims, Confuscianists, Scholars of a hundred schools, farmers, artisans, merchants, and all the other professions in the world, along with officials, eunuchs, bowmen, arrowfolk, cart-pushers, pole carriers, coal sellers, charcoal sellers, needle and thread sellers, pie and noodle sellers, pot-fixers and garlic sellers, pancake and doughnut sellers, tea and egg sellers.... all these people! They don't know what happened with the country, and why there was a proclamation, so they gathered up to get a look.\n\nAt this time, from the north there came a dude, whose last name is Sun and first name is Delong and a butcher in the East Quaduple Pailou Butcher's Street, and knows how to catch and butcher pigs. He originally came from Dengzhou, Shandong, and is around 40 years old. He likes to drink. Today he just came from the butchery, and held his pig hook in his armpit, which is a white waxed pole as thick as a walnut, a meter and half in length, and two bronze hooks at the tip. If the pig runs away, he can hook it back with one pull. He held his purse in one hand and his ledger in his other armpit. He had a rope for a belt and pewter liquor bottle hanging on it. The bottle was polished so much it lit up like a lamp from the reflection of the sun. He wore a cotton cloth robe, but it's checkered pattern? Why? Because he wipes his knife on it after he cuts everything, meat, intestines, whatever. As the days gone by it went the same way as the razor sharpener in the salon.\n\nSo he just had the drink of his life from the liquor bar after work, and his legs were quaking as his words slurred, \"This wine may be sorghum water, but it conquers the legs first on a man, can't see anything in front of me, like I've been possessed by a ghost!\" He saw that there's a circle of people surrounding the proclamation? \"I gotta see what this is about\", so he forced his way in. He saw the proclamation, but he's illiterate, so he asks around. He taps another dude on the shoulder, \n\n\"Yo! What's this shit?\"\n\nOther guy says, \"Slow down, man, careful you don't get a side stitch. This is an imperial proclamation!\"\n\n\"The hell is an imperial proclamation?\"\n\n\"Something the Emperor posted!\"\n\n\"Can you read it for me?\"\n\n\"Sure thing! Listen here, 'Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, his rescript reads as thus: In the seventh year of Chenghua, the Ryukyu Kingdom sends their tribute. In reality, however, they sent an old Taoist to test his power against us... \"\n\n\"All right stop! Don't read anymore. I don't understand any of this!?\"\n\n\"Oh, so I did this for nothing?\"\n\n\"So let me ask, what's the first two phrases?\"\n\n\"Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, His rescript reads as thus?\"\n\n\"The hell is 'His rescript reads as thus?'\"\n\n\"If the Emperor speaks, it's 'his rescript reads as thus'\"\n\n\"So what would be for me speaking?\"\n\n\"Uh... I don't know what would be reading as thus.\"\n\n\"Fine, continue\"\n\nThis man however's already tired of it since he has to read and then explain. He figured he might as well just tell Sun what it means, \"So basically the Ryukyu's are a vassal state that sends tribute and their declaration as our servant every year, but this year they sent an old Taoist, who knows how to do 36 styles of silent debate, and can recite 70 volumes of the 'Diamond Sutra', he's coming to to test his power against us Chinese. If we beat him, then they'll continue their tribute and declaration every year. If we can't, or nobody takes up the challenge, then they the Ryukyus are now the lords, and we Great Ming are now the vassal states. The Emperor thus sends out a proclamation seeking able people, who knows how to silently debate and recite the Diamond Sutra, to take up the challenge. If they can beat that old Taoist, the Emperor will give them any amounts of money or as high of a court position as possible! But it's useless for you, you don't know how to silent debate or recite the Diamond Sutra.\"\n\nHe just had to go there, because this Sun Delong has a name for being a \"jack of all trades\". If you say he's not capable of something, he's going to get mad, \"Stop! How do you know I don't know how to silent debate, or how to read the Diamond Sutra?\"\n\n\"Oh? So you can?\"\n\n\"If I don't, what do I have this head for?\"\n\n\"Ah! Then that's great! Take the proclamation and go challenge the old Taoist!\"\n\nSun was walking up to take the proclamation when the other guy thought that he should make absolutely sure, so he asked. \"The imperial proclamation says the old Taoist knows 36 styles of silent debate, do you?\"\n\n\"How many styles?\"\n\n\"36.\"\n\n\"I know 72.\"\n\n\"Wow! Twice the styles... The old Taoist can recite 70 volumes of the Diamond Sutra.\"\n\n\"And the Diamond Sutra I can recite is endless!\"\n\n\"Then take the proclamation.\"\n\n\"I can't reach.\"\n\n\"So what's that in your hand then?\"\n\n\"My pig hook.\"\n\n\"So use it to hook the proclamation then.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nHe hooked the proclamation off the post. The soldiers who were guarding the proclamation saw that a drunk had taken the proclamation, so they took out their rope and tied him up, pushing him to see the official in charge.\n\nThe official in charge is the Imperial Secretary Xie. However, Sun refused to kneel and instead turned his face in disgust, \"So what's your last name?\"\n\nMinister Xie was baffled, \"So he's prosecuting me instead the other way around? or what?\" He thought. \"It's 'Xie'.\"\n\n\"Minister Xie, do you have common sense?\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to take the old Taoist's challenge tied up?\"\n\n\"Oh? So you're the sorcerer?\"\n\nMinister Xie immediately reprimands the two soldiers. \"You reprehensible idiots! How can you bring the sorcerer to me tied up!\" He personally unties Sun. There's only one seat in the office. \"Sorcerer, please sit.\" Of course, it's supposed to be Minister Xie's seat, but Sun doesn't know that, so he sits right away. Not only does he sit, but he also annoyingly says, \"Oh, where would you sit then?\"\n\nMinister Xie has to reply, \"Then I'll stand.\"\n\n\"So, Minister, where do we find this damned Taoist?\"\n\n\"He's living in the Golden Terrace Institute in the Legation Quarter. That being said we must first go meet his majesty.\"\n\n\"What's a majesty?\"\n\n\"The Emperor\"\n\n\"Oh great, long time no see for us bros.\" Apparently, Sun's bros with the Emperor.\n\n\"So sorcerer, do you want to ride a horse or a litter to the palace?\"\n\n\"Neither.\"\n\n\"Neither? Then what sorcery will you use?\"\n\n\"I want to ride an ass.\"\n\n\"Ride an ass? Where do we find one for you?\"\n\n\"No ass, no go.\"\n\nMinister Xie was flabbergasted, but he personally went to the Zhangyi Gate to rent a donkey foal so Sun could ride it to the Palace. He had Sun wait in the East Court in the Palace.\n\nMinister Xie reports to the Emperor, and the Emperor was pleased. He orders an immediate audience. However, Minister Xie ponders a bit and decides that he can't let Sun see the Emperor, because Sun hasn't practiced the proper protocols in the Ministry of Rites, and he doesn't know what might come out of Sun's mouth. If Sun goes up to the Emperor and says something like \"Yo bro, long time no see\", then Minister Xie would certainly lose his head. Thus, Minister Xie immediately says, \"Your majesty, the sorcerer isn't a native of Beijing, and just came recently. He also hasn't practiced the propr protocols in the Ministry of Rites, so I fear he may offend your majesty with his improper behavior. If it were up to me, I would send him to take the challenge first, and have an audience after. If he defeats the old Taoist, then it's easier to forgive his transgressions in behavior.\"\n\nThus, the Emperor agrees and sends for the old Taoist in the Golden Terrace Institute, telling him that China has in fact found someone to accept his challenge. The old Taoist orders two 10-meter platforms be built in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and a table, incense burners, offerings, candelabrum, scroll paper, cinnabar brush, vegetables, grains, and a bowl or rainwater.\n\n\"Whatever your sorcerer wants, tell him to prepare himself.\" The old Taoist says, but Minister Xie ponders and just orders the same things for Sun. The orders were fulfilled quickly. The old Taoist shook his robe, and a dark whirlwind blew, lifting him onto his platform. The officials in court were shocked.\n\nThe emperor sends his edict, \"Minister Xie, ask our sorcerer to take the challenge, and also ride the wind or cloud up to the platform.\" Minister Xie immediately goes to the East Court to find the \"sorcerer\". He goes in and sees Xun sleeping on the floor. Minister Xie goes up and yells, \"Sorcerer! Wake up!\"\n\n\"Quit disturbing me!\"\n\n\"Who's disturbing you! Pull him up.\"\n\nSun rubs his eyes, and looks around. This is inside the palace, and it's golden all over.\n\n\"Ay! Old Minister! Where the hell is this?\"\n\n\"In the palace.\"\n\n\"What am I doing here in the palace?\"\n\n\"What? Did you forget? You're here to take the old Taoist's challenge. He's on the platform waiting for you. The Emperor also moved his throne outside to see you two duel.\"\n\nSun was terrified, \"What?!\" He was, of course, completely drunk, and after sleeping for so long he had forgotten pretty much everything. After Minister Xie explains, he starts thinking: I've drank too much, and in my drunken stupor I took the imperial proclamation, I'm just a goddamn merchant, how the hell do I know how to duel with old Taoists? Besides, it appears that this guy is from another country, so he must have evil intentions. Now I've really done it! He immediately slaps himself in the face four times, \"I'm an idiot! an idiot!\"\n\nHe kneels down to Minister Xie, \"Old minister, I've had too much to drink! It was the alcohol! I'm a butcher, please find someone else to duel! I can't do this at all! If this isn't enough for you, please slap me some more, and let me go with the wind like a kite!\"\n\n\"Ah!?\"\n\nMinister Xie's rage boiled over and he shook, his hat quaking. He's both angry and scared, \"Oh? You had too much to drink? You're right, this is way too much! Can you still feel your head on your neck? Just slap you and let you go? You can say this to me, fine, if I tell the same to the Emperor, then I've deceived him and failed the country. Deceiving him might be no big deal, but the country will be in trouble. This old Taoist is already there, what is His Majesty going to say to him? How will the country handle the shame? Neither of us will keep our heads for this. You're the drunk idiot that pulled the proclamation and tricked the official in charge, I'm the one that failed in office and allowed idiots into the palace, and deceived the Emperor and failed the country. Even if we get our deserved death, what is the Emperor to do? He will lose face, and our China will lose face. The Ryukyu will be lord and Ming will be vassal, and the Empire will be destroyed and our people enslaved!\"\n\nSun Delong hears this and also starts to panic, which brought the alcohol back into his bloodstream, so he jumps up.\n\n\"Old Minister, it's fine! If neither of us will live, then it's easy to deal with. If we're to die regardless of whether I duel the old Taoist or not, then let's just duel so at least we'll die with our wounds in front. Even if we lose our head, it's just going to be a scab the size of a bowl. Maybe I'm not as good at sorcery as he is, but it's not certain he can fight as well as me! Let's go find him.\"\n\nMinister Xie hears this and wonders, \"Does he know how to duel or not?\" \n\n\"Just go!\" Minister Xie, out of options, leads him to the platforms and points to the one in the east, \"See? He's already meditating up there.\"\n\nSun Delong takes a look and says, \"Then I'm going on the other one. If we go on the same one, we'd fight for that territory.\"\n\n\"Just go!\"\n\n\"How tall is it?\"\n\n\"Ten meters!\"\n\n\"Ten meters? Even if it's 30, that's no big deal, attendants!.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Get me a ladder.\"\n\n\"Ladders are a no-go, the Emperor has already ordered that you ride the wind or clouds, because the old Taoist took the wind up.\"\n\nThe old Taoist, in fact, did not ride the wind. It's a trick. Inside his sleeve is an iron cylinder with wolf manure, charcoal, and Mayflower gloryberry inside, lit up. When he needs it, he shakes his robes and the cylinder's cover falls off, black smoke then pours out of it from his sleeves and neckline. Wolf manure provides the constant burn, but it's the mayflower that provides the black smoke that looks like a dark whirlwind surrounding him. Thus, with that cover he simply climbs up using hooks worn on his arm and legs.\n\nSun Delong hears about wind and cloud, so he asks, \"What kind of wind?\"\n\n\"Obviously, the Guiding Wind.\"\n\n\"All I know is passing wind.\"\n\n\"That won't do.\"\n\n\"Fuck it then, I'm not going without a ladder.\"\n\n\"Don't!\"\n\nSun Delong again panics and paces in circles around the platform.\n\n\"Don't go there, the Emperor is there!\"\n\n\"I need to sneak a peek\"\n\nMinister Xie was annoyed. Who peeks at the Emperor?\n\n\"Who's sitting there?\" Sun asks,\n\n\"The Emperor, obviously.\"\n\n\"So who's the eight giants next to him?\"\n\n\"That's the guards, The Golden Macemen.\"\n\n\"What's that in their hands?\"\n\n\"The Golden Maces\"\n\n\"So bring the tallest one to me. I have something to discuss with him.\"\n\nMinister Xie goes and sees that it is in fact Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Bai Wenyuan.\n\n\"Lord Bai, here's a friend that wants to meet you, the sorcerer Sun who's here to duel. This is Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Lord Bai Wenyuan\"\n\n\"Oh, Minister Bai, good tiding to you, please help me.\"\n\n\"What do you need?\"\n\n\"I need to get up there\"\n\n\"What's that got to do with me?\"\n\n\"Without you I can't get up there.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Think, this platform is ten meters tall, how tall are you?\"\n\n\"Me? His majesty only picks the tallest for his guard. I'm in fact two meters seven.\"\n\n\"What about the golden mace?\"\n\n\"Handle is four meters two, three decimeters for the mace, total four meters five.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's right. Four meters five plus two meters seven, that's seven meters two. It's only a bit from ten meters.\"\n\nWhat's he calculating? Bai Wenyuan wonders.\n\n\"So, just let me sit on the mace, and you catapult me up there...\" Sun says.\n\n\"What? I...'ve never heard of this!\"\n\n\"If you don't, I'm leaving.\"\n\nMinister Xie immediately runs over, \"Lord Bai, please help him and just give it a try.\"\n\nBai Wenyuan was shaking with anger. Just what the hell is this? But he complies anyway. He lets Sun climb onto the mace, and vaults. With his strength, Sun flies 14 meters into the air, way past the platform. It would seem like Sun is in trouble because of the fall, but he was actually okay. Remember he has that meter and half hook? He reached the hook out to the platform to break his fall, and slid down it once it reached. Not only was he not injured, but he actually arrived standing up.\n\nThe old Taoist was meditating with his eyes closed, so he didn't see what Sun Delong was doing at all. When he opened his eyes, all he saw was Sun descending from 14 meters in the air. He was frightened, \"Wow! There are indeed talented people in China! I only rode the whirlwind, they came straight from heaven!\"\n\nHe then takes a look at Sun Delong and was even more frightened, \"This man has fortuitous clouds at his feet and golden light protecting his body!\" The reason is, of course, that Sun had kicked the incense pot over when he landed, and the incense ash poured out around him. As for the golden light, it's because of his oiled cotton clothes, which reflected brightly in the sunlight. Usually in battle, the side that loses their heart first loses, the old Taoist was shaking with fear. He warns himself to be careful, which only psyched himself out more. He holds out his hand and speaks.\n\n\"Amita!\"\n\nEven though he's short, his voice was like a bronze bell. The old Taoist has invoked his first chant, and Sun thinks to himself that he must return one.\n\n\"Good stuff!\"\n\nSo the old Taoist says:\n\n\"Amitabha!\"\n\nAnd he hears that the old Taoist has added a syllable, so he adds a bunch.\n\n\"A bunch of junk stuff!\"\n\nThe old Taoist was baffled. \"I don't have that much stuff!\" He thinks, \"Might as well silently debate then!\" He holds out a finger, which means:\n\n\"Don't underestimate me, I have The One Buddha saluting me!\" \n\nSun of course, doesn't know that. He says he knew how to silently debate, but it's not the same thing. It's the kind of debate he has with customers in the butchery. He sees that the old Taoist has held out a finger, and was enraged, \n\n\"What's this? He thinks he's one generation older than me? Fuck you!\"\n\nHe holds out two fingers. What does he mean?\n\n\"You think you're my uncle? Your dad's two generations behind me!\"\n\nThe old Taoist thought, \"Wow! My one finger is The One Buddha saluting me, so he counters with Two Saints shielding him!\" He then raises three fingers, which means \"The Three August ones rules the Earth\". Sun Delong doesn't know, but he thinks:\n\n\"This is a trick, he raises one so I give him two, he's going to give me three, but if I give him four he's giving me five, and I don't have six fingers to give back. Therefore, I'm taking the five first!\"\n\nThe old Taoist was amazed, \"The Three August Ones rules the Earth\" is indeed countered by \"The Five Emperors are sovereign.\" He then slaps his chest, meaning \"The One Buddha in my heart.\" Sun was again enraged, \"So now you think you're my father-in-law?\" He slaps his head, which means \"You think you're my father-in-law? I'm slapping you and your daughter!\" The old Taoist again saw that his \"The One Buddha in my heart\" being countered by \"Heaven is above my head\".\n\nThe old Taoist had to evaluate his options - he couldn't win the silent debate, so he took the scroll paper and pulls his sword out. \"What? Is he going to slit his own throat?\" The Taoist cuts the paper into three pieces and drew a charm on each with the cinnabar brush. He lights the candelabrum and then the scroll with the candle. He starts chanting as he shakes his sword, and the scroll starts burning brighter, which he wants to use to burn Sun Delong. Sun Delong taunts him, \"Playing with fire? Aren't you a bit old for this? If you play with fire too much you'll piss your bed at night, and your mother will spank you!\"\n\nThe old Taoist was incensed, so he continues to spin the fire, which grew from the size of a teacup to a plate. Why didn't it burn out the scroll? It's because the old Taoist has applied a special formula with the cinnabar to keep it burning. He threw the flaming scroll at the other platform, and it flew towards Sun's face. Sun dodges to the left and lets it pass, but his hair, which Ming Dynasty people usually wear in a bun on their head, caught fire, and half of his head was burnt off. Luckily for Sun, there was a bowl of rainwater on the platform, so he took it and put the fire out. The Old Taoist sees the charm has failed, so he starts burning the second one. Sun Delong sees this and was angered, \"Oh, so you're kicking me while I'm down? You want to burn the other half so I'd have to become a monk and go beg for food with you? Fuck that! I'm attacking first!\" He takes his hook and aims it at the old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist was still chanting with his eyes closed, which gave Sun enough time to aim. He throws the pig hook tail first towards the old Taoist \"Look at this stuff!\" If he didn't yell this he'd hit the old Taoist in the face, but since he yelled, the old Taoist opens his eyes and sees something flying towards him. \"Amita!\" He yells and dodges to the right. The pole of course missed, but the hooks behind it didn't, and cleaves two strands of flesh right off the old Taoist's cheek. \"Amitabhaaaaaaaaaaaa!\" The old Taoist screams. Sun Delong taunts again, \"Doesn't pay attention, take this stuff!\" \n\nThe old Taoist examines the pig hook and doesn't know what it is, and becomes more frightened, \"Aya! I forgot he descended from heaven and has fortuitous clouds and golden light shielding him! This man is a true arhat and even has Gautama Buddha's Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook!\"\n\nSun Delong was delighted! \"Idiot! My hair can still grow back, what pot-fixer can repair your face?\"\n\nThis only served to frighten the old Taoist more, as he also noticed Sun's purse and wine bottle hanging on his belt. In his panic he thought they were the hundred-treasure pouch and heaven-flipping seal. As he kept frightening himself, he finally decided to use the foremost stratagem of the thirty six - retreat!\n\n\"Amita! I'm going back to my country to report!\"\n\n\"If you leave I'm using my power!\"\n\n\"No, Don't! I'll report to your Emperor first!\"\n\nThe old Taoist leaps off the platform and runs up to the Hall of Supreme Harmony, kowtowing again and again. \"Please forgive your vassal's transgressions! Please forgive your vassal's transgressions!\"\n\nOf course, the Emperor didn't understand any of it. He only heard the stuff about \"Amita\" and \"Good stuff\" and didn't get it. He then saw the old Taoist setting things on fire and then Sun Delong putting it out with water. \"Of course! Water beats fire!\" He then saw the old Taoist lighting fire again, and was annoyed, but then while he was staring at the fire, he saw that the Taoist's cheeks were then gashed. He clapped happily, \"We've won! Good! Good!\" He saw that the old Taoist has descended and knew that the old Taoist admitted defeat.\n\n\"What do you have to say?\"\n\n\"Ah! Your majesty! Please forgive us! We admit defeat and will tribute and declare every year!\"\n\n\"Of course! We must know, however, what is 'Amita'?\"\n\n\"That's how we Taoists greet people.\"\n\n\"What about his 'Good stuff'?\"\n\n\"I don't know, what's good stuff?\"\n\n\"What about 'Amitabha'?\"\n\n\"It's also a greeting.\"\n\n\"What about his 'A bunch of junk stuff!'?\"\n\n\"He has too much stuff\" The old Taoist points to his cheek \"Look at this stuff I took!\"\n\n\"Then what was that finger?\"\n\n\"The One Buddha saluting me!\" \n\n\"What about his two?\"\n\n\"Two Saints shielding him!\" \n\n\"What about your three?\"\n\n\"'The Three August Ones rules the Earth', then your sorcerer counters with 'The Five Emperors are sovereign.' I slapped my chest meaning 'The One Buddha in my heart', and he counters with a slap on his head meaning 'Heaven is above my head'\".\n\n\"So what about that fire?\"\n\n\"Please forgive me! I wanted to toss him off the platform.\"\n\n\"For a man of mercy you sure are merciless! What about your face?\"\n\n\"Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook.\"\n\nSo then he was dismissed and goes to await the Emperor's judgment.\n\nThe Emperor's attendant then looks on the platform \"Wait, why is our sorcerer still up there?\" Of course, Sun Delong couldn't get down, and he's pacing on the platform wondering if he had won or not. The Emperor sees and says, \"Our sorcerer must be wounded by that demon fire, have somebody help him down.\" So immediately a ladder was raised and Sun Delong gets off the platform. Minister Xie walks over and says, \"The Emperor requires your audience, just kowtow and try not to speak.\" Why? He's still afraid of that possible \"Hey bro, long time no see\". Sun Delong enters the Hall of Supreme Harmony and salutes the Emperor, \"Hey!\" \n\nAre you going to bite me? The Emperor wonders, but then Sun says.\n\n\"I am kowtowing to your majesty.\"\n\nOf course, since he won, the Emperor was happy, \"Raise your head.\"\n\nNormally, it's against protocol to raise your head and you're supposed to say, \"It's a crime to\" and the Emperor would then say, \"We pardon it\", but Sun Deleng doesn't know that and raises his head immediately to stare at the Emperor, \"What?\"\n\nThe Emperor laughed, \"So did you win or not?\"\n\nSun Delong is afraid of this, because he doesn't know if he won or not. He lowers his head. The Emperor asks again, \"Did you win or not?\" He turns his head and sees the old Taoist, so when the Emperor asks a third time, he answers, \"Your majesty, I can't answer that. If I say I won, then I'm boasting, but if I say I didn't win, what did I come here for? If you don't have the skills you don't get the kills.\"\n\nMinister Xie is annoyed, \"What's all this small talk?\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me who won, you should ask him. If he says I lost then I lost, if I said I won then I won. Old Taoist! If you say I lost, then let's go back up there for round two!\"\n\nThe old Taoist holds his cheek and says, \"Please no! He won!\"\n\n\"What's the sorcerer's name?\" The Emperor asks.\n\n\"My name is Sun Delong and I live in the butchery street. The Delong Butchery is mine. I've never cheated a customer and you'll always get 16 ounces to your pound!\"\n\nWho asked him about that?\n\n\"So after you met, what's 'Amita'?\" The Emperor asks.\n\n\"Oh that's simple! I know him.\"\n\nThe old Taoist was surprised. He knows me? I don't know him?\n\n\"This man is here to beg for money.\"\n\n\"Why 'Amita'?\"\n\n\"In my butchery, whenever someone comes to beg, if it's a monk they'll say 'Mitabha\", if it's a Taoist they'll say, \"Amita', both means 'Give me money.'\"\n\n\"Then what's 'Good stuff'?\"\n\n\"I said 'Good stuff' because I was thinking, 'How the hell is there another one when two already begged from me?\"\n\nThe old Taoist starts to grimace.\n\n\"Then in the silent debate, what's that one finger?\"\n\nSun Delong however started thinking: Maybe the Emperor is going to punish the old Taoist, and the worst punishment is the nine familial exterminations. If I tell the Emperor about that generation stuff, then even if it's four generations apart it's still not out of the nine. I need to say something else. This is where the old Taoist is finally mentally slain:\n\n\"Your majesty, we were discussing business.\"\n\n\"How so? He sticks one out, you stick two, he then sticks three and you stick five. He slaps his chest and you slap your head. Isn't that silent debate?\"\n\n\"No, your majesty, it's business\"\n\n\"What kind of business?\"\n\n\"He knows I'm a butcher, and in his temple there's going to be a feast, so he wants to buy a pig. I tell him go ahead, I even have two for you. He wants one that's at least three hundred pounds, I tell him I've got ones that's more than five hundred pounds, he asks if the heart, liver and lungs come with it, and I tell him that he can have the pig head too!\"\n\ntl'dr: Chinese xiangsheng piece parallel of the Muslim Ban joke that u/GaryV83_at_Work put up.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Maybe if I just trimmed my beard a bit, he would let me alone.\"\n\n\nThe next few minutes found Benjamin in his bathroom facing the mirror, scissors in hand. Taking a deep breath, he placed the scissors close to his chin to cut off the ends of his beard. His hand began to close, and just as the first few strands of hair were severed from his body---\n\n\n\"**FOOL!** You ignored my command, and for that, you shall *die*!\" shouted the genie, who appeared out of nowhere.\n\n\nSuddenly, Benjamin was no more, and all that was left was an ancient-looking urn on the ground where his feet had been planted.\n\nAnd that was the end of Benjamin.\n\n\nNow, what can we learn from this sad, sad tale?\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n*A Benny shaved, is a Benny urned.*\n",

He's got good looks, money, a luxurious loft apartment, and a convertible sports car. You can be sure that all of the ladies want him, but of all the things he has, there is one thing that he just wasn't happy with: the size of his penis. \n\nJohn decides he has enough money to get a penis enlargement. I mean, if a woman can get her barely an A mosquito bites exploded into bodacious DD tatas, then why can't he go from teenage Asian to Mandingo? \n\nSo John makes an appointment to see a penis enlargement specialist. \n\nAfter waiting a few days he finally gets into his appointment he has been so anxious about. The surgeon asks: \"So what can I do for you today John?\" to which John replies \"Y'know doc, I'm just not too happy with the size of my penis. It's kind of... ^small.\" The doctor thinks for a minute and then says: \"Well, John, unfortunately I'm fresh out of penises at the moment. We won't really be able to do anything for you until I get my next shipment in a couple months.\" John seems devastated. He can't believe that he has to go on this date knowing this girl will laugh as soon as she catches a glimpse of his little Vienna sausage. He begs the doctor: \"Please! There has to be *something* you can do to help me. I'm begging you!\" The doctor responds: \"Hmm.. give me just a moment.\" He walks out of the room, and returns a few minutes later. \"I have potential good news for you John, but I'm not sure if you're going to be up for it. You see, I'm fresh out of penises, but I *do* have this baby elephant trunk. I know it's a bit odd, but it will make Mandingo looks like a little school boy.\" John thinks for a minute, and decides it isn't such a bad idea. \"Anything is better than what I'm packing right now.\" John says.\n\nJohn schedules the procedure, and ends up recovering a few days before his date. \n\nThe big day comes, and John is more confident than ever. He picks her up in the roadster, makes undeniably confident eye contact, and is making her laugh all the way to the restaurant. Really, everything has been going beautifully. They arrive at a *fancy* restaurant, valet parks his car, and they are seated immediately. A minute later the waiter comes with a basket of bread rolls, places them on the table, and asks what they would like to drink. John orders them both the most expensive bottle of wine they had. The waiter leaves to retrieve the wine while John and his beautiful date look over the menu. John tells her that she can have *anything* she'd like. \"Don't even look at the pricing, money isn't an issue.\" he says. The waiter returns with the wine, and they place their order. While waiting for their food they decide to dig into the rolls. They both get a roll, butter it, and begin eating. Everything seems dandy, and then out of **nowhere** a baby elephant trunk **SHOOTS** up from under the table, grabs a roll, and disappears. John's date was **amazed**. \"**WOAH!** Can you do that again?!\" she said. To which he replied:\n\n\"I can, but I don't think I could fit another roll up my ass.\"\n\n",

They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.\"\n\nBut the roaring flames held the fire fighters off.\n\nSoon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department that could bring out the company's secret files.\n\nFrom the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the large newer fire trucks that were parked around the plant.\n\nWithout even slowing down, the old truck drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other fire\nfighters watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.\n\nWithin a short time, the Norske old timers had the fire well under control and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.\n\nThe local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, \"What are you going to do with all that money?\"\n\n\"Vell,\" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, \"Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat focking truck!\"",

She's my wife! I'm supposed to find her arousing. She looked so good, I grabbed her, we kissed, and then we ripped off all of our clothes and had wild, passionate, loud, messy sex right there on the floor.\"\n\nThe pastor stood up, shook his head in disgust and said with considerable exasperation as he motioned toward the door, \"I'm sorry. But you are no longer welcome here at this church.\"\n\nThey got up to leave and the wife said, \"That's okay. We're not welcome at Kroger anymore either.\"\n",

What was that?!\"\n\nSo she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...\"You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.\"\n\nShe responded to my puzzled look by saying, \"Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?\"\n\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.\n\nThe very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.\n\nLet me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, \"That's fine, honey.\"\n\nShe appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, \"I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.\"\n\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, \"No honey, I don't feel like it.\"\n\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, \"WHAT?\"\n\nI then said \"Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.\n\nYou're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.\"\n\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, \"Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?\"\n\nApparently, no sex tonight either!\n\n\n\nEdit: Didn't expect to make front page but glad lots of you got a laugh out of it!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold!

It serves, therefore, as a valuable cautionary tale.\n\nThe first flaw in the anecdote\u2019s construction is in its gratuitous use of ethnicity as a crutch. To be sure, Jews serve as an invaluable comedy resource. Any joke involving miserliness of any kind can be improved by the addition of a Hebraic surname (or, in the alternative, by the addition of the prefix \u201cMac.\u201d) But here, \u201cJewishness\u201d does not improve the comedy one wit. Any ethnicity will scream when placed in an oven. You throw an Irishman into an oven, and see if he doesn\u2019t cry out \u201cBegosh and begorrah, I\u2019ve been thrown into an oven!\u201d So too the Mexican, whose refrain of \u201cAi yi yi, es mui caliente!\u201d is equally plausible. Indeed, the only person who should ever be thrown into an oven in comedy is Sylvia Plath.\n\nMany of you may object, \u201cBut what of the Holocaust? Surely that validates the choice of \u2018Jew\u2019 in the set-up?\u201d\n\nFar from it. One must be very careful when relying on history as validation. The Nazis threw very few screaming Jews into the oven. This is not Holocaust revisionism, it\u2019s simply fact. The Germans are a very efficient people, and they killed almost all their victims before disposing of their bodies in factory-like furnaces. To do otherwise would slow their production lines of death down, and that would be intolerable to the German psyche. No, no. The corpses that were thrown into the ovens went in not unlike the aforementioned pizza \u2013 silently.\n\nThus, the fundamental logic of the joke is ruined. The difference does not hold up under historical scrutiny. \n\nSo when you are asked to contemplate the difference between a Jew and a pizza, plausible answer is: \u201cOne is a human being with a human soul and a human mind and inherent human dignity, and the other is a molded dough product.\u201d Or \u201cYou take the pizza out of the oven in one piece.\u201d\n\n",

The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire via a steel chain and collar. \n2. The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.\n3. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the phone number was called.\n4. After a couple of such jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate on himself and the ground.\n5.

        "body": "There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n\nCoincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n\n\"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n\n\"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\n/ till the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\n.' '.\n. .\n. .\nhe jumped.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n:\nSlowly at first,\n:\nbut speeding up,\n:\n:\n:\nfaster, and faster,\n:\nspeeding past Pluto,\n:\nand the other outer planets,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nthrough the asteroid belt,\n\npast Mars,\n\nand the moon,\n\nfaster,\n\nand faster,\n\nfaster - ever faster,\n\nand by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\npast the albatross,\n\ndouble-back somersault,\n\nand he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,\n\nhurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,\n\nDown on the ship the crew strained their necks,\n\n\"I CAN SEE HIM!\" yelled a passenger, \"LOOK!!!\"\n\nThe tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...\n\nNOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE WATER!\n\nSMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!\n\nDOWN!\n\nDOWN!\n\nTHROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!\n\nTHROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!\n\nAND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!\n\nSTILL DOWN...!\n\nDEEPER,\n\nDEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,\n\nTILL.........\n\nSMASH!\n\nInto the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.\n\nDesperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.\n\nUp and up, desperate, gasping...\n\nOut of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.\n\n\"HERO!\" \"WONDERFUL!\" \"AMAZING!\" \"GOOD SHOW THAT!\"\n\nAnd handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.\n\n\"Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.\"\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see...\n\nI'm a just poor tramp...\n\nso you must understand...\n\nI've been through many a hard ship in my life.\"\n",

        "body": "...down a rural country road. It was a gorgeous sight against the red and orange sunset. He had been riding for about an hour and passed all sorts of country sights. A tractor in a field. Cows grazing. A canopy tunnel of trees. And different novelty mailboxes including a bright pink one. . Suddenly a downpour came upon him. The sudden rain made the roads very slippery and he wound up laying the bike over in a ditch. This caused some parts to come loose and hoses break. He reached for his phone but  it was soaked and unable to turn on after the accident.\n\nStranded and alone, he decided to walk down the road back the way he came. The pink mailbox was less than a mile away and he figured there was a house nearby. As he finally started to reach the pink mailbox, he noticed there were pink flowers planted around it. He thought nothing of it and made his way down the long now-muddy road. After a few minutes he came upon a huge pink gate with pink railings and a pink call box.\n\nThe man rang the pink box and a pink tinted screen came on with an old lady answering,\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the man. \u201cI\u2019ve been riding down the road and had an accident. Would it be alright if I came in and used your phone? My cell phone is soaked.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d said the old woman. And the huge pink gate gave a creak as it opened up.\n\nThe man walked through the huge pink gate and walked up to her house. It was a massive, 3-story, colonial style house with a porch that wrapped completely around. And it was all pink. The house had pink bushes planted in front. Pink steps with pink banisters led up to the pink porch with pink rocking chairs and pink ceiling fans. He walked up and rang the pink doorbell which gave out a very bright and pleasant \u201cding.\u201d \n\nThe large pink front door opened up and the old woman greeted him with a smile. She was wearing a pink nightgown and pink slippers.\n\n\u201cPlease, come in,\u201d she said, and motioned her little hand inside.\n\nAs the man stepped inside, his jaw dropped. Every single thing inside the house was pink. The tile on the floor was two-toned, checkerboard style pink. The curtains we pink with pink embroidery embellishments. Even the frames on the windows were pink. He took a step and started to take his muddy boots off when he noticed the pink umbrella holder and pink coat rack. \n\n\u201cYou are soaked to the bone! Would you like a towel to dry off?\u201d asked the little pink woman.\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d answered the man.\n\n\u201cGo into the kitchen. The telephone is in there,\u201d she instructed, as she went into another room.\n\nThe man made his way across the entry room into the kitchen. His hand lightly swept across the pink dresser, along the pink walls and pink trim, down the pink door frame, and to the small pink dining table. He sat in a pink chair and picked up the pink rotary phone. Even the telephone wire was pink. He attempted to dial a number but the phone seemed to be disconnected.\n\nThe little pink lady came in with a large pink towel and handed it to the man. It was warm as if it had just come out of the clothes dryer.\n\n\u201cThank you so much,\u201d said the man. \u201cBut I think your phone is disconnected because of the storm.\u201d\n\nThe pink lady responded,\u201dOh, that\u2019s a shame. Well, if you need to you can stay in one of the guest bedrooms for the night.\u201d\n\nThe man thanked her for her kindness and made his way up the pink stairs, holding onto the pink banister. He walked down the pink hallway with pink wallpaper. He walked into a bedroom and found it to be completely pink. On the pink bed were some pink pajamas, a pink robe, another pink towel, and a pink travel toothbrush wrapped in plastic. He took the pink towel, pink robe, and pink toothbrush and went to the bathroom to wash up before bed.\n\nIn the bathroom, the man undressed and used the pink soap and pink shampoo to wash himself. Then he dried himself with the pink towel and put on the pink robe. He used the pink sink to brush his teeth with the pink toothbrush with the pink toothpaste that was already in the pink bathroom.\n\nHe then went back into the pink bedroom and changed into his pink pajamas. He laid down on the bed and covered himself with the pink blanket and pink sheet. Then, laying his head down on the pink pillow, he fell right to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, the man woke up and made his way downstairs. In the hallway, he ran into two other men. They introduced themselves and explained to each other why they were there. One man had slid into a ditch near the motorcycle accident and lost his phone. The other man was the pink lady\u2019s nephew who came in earlier that morning. \n\nAfter making their way down, they came upon the little old lady was already dressed in a pink top and pink pants with little pink shoes. She was carrying the man\u2019s clothes and asked the gentlemen if they would like breakfast.\n\n\u201cWould you like bacon and eggs or oatmeal?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have oatmeal, Auntie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have bacon and eggs,\u201d said the man in the car accident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have bacon and eggs, as well,\u201d said the man in the motorcycle accident.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said the little pink lady. \n\nShe made the breakfast with her pink cooking utensils and pink pots and pans. The bacon sizzled and steam rose into the pink vent. She took out some pink plates and pink silverware and set them on the table where the men were seated. She brought down some pink glasses and poured each man some strawberry milk.\n\nThey all ate and were satisfied with their breakfast. The man tried the phone again and it was working. He called his wife and asked her to come pick him up. The man in the car accident used the phone and asked his roommate to pick him up.\n\nA few hours later, the wife and the roommate both show up and pick up their respective husband and friend. And they all lived happily ever after.\n\nThere is one conclusion we can take from this story.\n\nTwo out of three men prefer bacon and eggs over oatmeal.",

He said to the doctor, \"Doc, I think my wife is hard of hearing. Sometimes when I ask her questions she can't hear me. What should I do?\" The doctor replied, \"Here's what you need to do. Tonight while your wife is making dinner in the kitchen, go into the bedroom and ask her what's for dinner. If she doesn't hear you, go into the living room and ask again. If she doesn't hear you while you're in the living room, go into the dining room and ask a third time. If she still can't hear you even from the dining room, go into the kitchen and ask one more time. If she can't hear you while you're in the kitchen, then she must be losing her hearing.\"\n\nSo the man took the doctor's advice and tested it out on his wife that night. First, he went into the bedroom and called out to his wife, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" No response. So he moved into the living room. He called out again, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" No response. So he moved again, this time into the dining room. \"Honey what's for dinner?\" Still no response. So finally, he moved into the kitchen where his wife was making dinner and asked once more, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" His wife turned to look at him with an angry look on her face and said, \"Chicken.

        "body": " Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all Muslims had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Muslim community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Muslim community. If the Muslims won, they could stay in Italy; and if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.\n\nThe Muslim people met and picked an aged and wise Mufti to represent them in the debate. However, as the Mufti didn't speak Italian, and the Pope didn't speak Arabic, they agreed that it would be a \"silent\" debate.\n\nOn the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Mufti looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his fingers around his head. The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Moulana was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy.\n\nLater the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God! Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He beat me at every move and I could not continue!\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won. \"I haven't a clue,\" the Mufti said. \"First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him as they call it 'the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!\" \"And then what?\" asked a woman. \"Who knows?\" said the Mufti. \"He took out his lunch so I took out mine.\"\n\nEdit: First time I heard this joke was around a year ago, but I had never heard the Jewish one until shortly after. So yeah, I'm well aware it's a repost, but, obviously by the votes, not that many people heard it the first time around (or second, third...fifth...twenty-second...etc.) so thank you, but it has already been pointed out.",

One of them manages to convince Paul, in his drunk state, that anything is edible when combined with enough potatoes and pastry. Paul thinks that this is the most amazing thing he's ever heard, and runs home to test it. After getting home, he looks around for non-food items to eat with potatoes, and eventually settles on the idea of trying to eat a Biro.\n\nSo he smashes the Biro into small pieces, combines it with a few potatoes, puts the mixture in a savoury pastry, and bakes it for a while. After it's baked, he's slightly less drunk and realises it's not such a great idea to try and eat a Biro, but he knows his friends won't let him forget it if he reneges on his commitment, so he eats it anyway. It takes him a while, and by the time he's finished he feels tired from chewing and wants to wait for the potato to digest, so he decides to try and sleep for a while.\n\nWhile he's half sleeping and half just lying there, Paul - predictably enough - is thinking about Biros, and has a brainwave. His company can put their logo on anything and double the price, right? So why not start selling incredibly expensive writing implements? He writes this down in a fit of genius and takes it into the office the next day. He tells his manager about the idea, who then tells their own manager, and so on and so on. Apparently, someone at the top liked the idea, because the following month, Tim Cook calls a press conference to introduce his new product.\n\nTim walks up onto the stage holding a long, thin object. A larger picture comes up on screen - it's a Biro, but it's made of a light grey plastic and has the company logo on it. Tim announces that the stylish new design is going to be called the *iWrite*, and that it will cost $150 at launch.\n\nHowever, to this day, within that office, it's still referred to by everyone who knows its origin as *pen-pie-nap Paul's Apple pen*.",

You aren't telling me anything that I don't already know.\" \n\nThe doctor tosses the man's file onto his desk before cupping his hands over his mouth in momentary thought. \"You don't seem to understand the *weight* of your situation so let me attempt to break this down for you. I have been in practice for almost 15 years and you are literally the fattest man who has ever walked into this office. You aren't just fat, you are at a level of obesity that I personally didn't even think was medically possible. The fact that you were able to walk into this office on your own strength alone is a miracle that would make Jesus Christ ask *How'd he do that?* and that guy walked on water. \n\nWhen we did your blood work, your blood sugar level was at 500 which effectively makes you a brand of coffee sweetener. I couldn't even take your blood pressure with a normal pressure cuff because of how fat your arms are. I had to jerry-rig a cuff out of the spare tire of my Ford F150. Your cholesterol level came back as Land-O-Lakes. My goal is to try and get that to \"I can't believe it's not butter\" but even that's a long shot. Your blood was so thick and meaty that we received a call from the blood center asking us why we decided to send them a tube of Ragu to analyze. Are you following me on this or do you need me to give you some more examples?\"\n\nThe room goes quiet again as the severely obese man stares at the doctor with a face that is beat red from anger. \n\n\"You know what? I didn't come in here to be insulted. I came here to get my medical results from someone who I thought was supposed to be helping me. You may think that you're trying to help me but what exactly are you accomplishing by being such a scumbag about it?\"\n\nThe doctor goes silent for a moment before finally responding. \n\n\"I was gonna sugar coat it but I was concerned you might eat me.\"",

Do you think I could stay the night?\u201dThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201dThe man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201dThe man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\u201dThe monks reply, \u201cYou must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201dThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201dThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201dThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201dThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201dThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201dThe man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can't tell you because you're not a monk.",

        "body": "Frank owned a full grown African Elephant and due to the rising costs of living, he found it was getting expensive to feed his pet. \n\nFrank thought long and hard for a solution and upon watching a circus program on T.V. thought of the perfect scam to make some quick money. \n\nYou see Frank had seen elephants stand on three legs, two legs, and even one leg, but he had never seen a full grown elephant take all four feet off the ground at once. \n\nSo he created a challenge and put it out in the newspapers and T.V. The challenge was for someone to get the elephant to take all four feet off the ground at once without using any device that would actually lift the elephant from the ground such as a crane, hoist, or the like, if successful they would receive a 10,000 dollar cash prize, but the catch was they had to pay 100 dollars to try.\n\nTurned out people came from far and wide, even other countries. Everyone tried everything they could from coaxing to hypnosis to threats, but try as they might everyone failed in their attempt. \n\nFrank was elated, his scheme was working brilliantly and he was making some nice dough.\n\nOne day a blue convertible pulled into the driveway and a man in a leather jacket got out and approached Frank.\n\n\"Good afternoon sir, Is it true that if I can get your elephant to take all his feet off the ground at once I'll win 10,000 dollars?\"\n\nFrank replied. \"Good afternoon to you too sir, yes it is true, but you have to pay 100 dollars per attempt.\"\n\nThe man nodded and agreed. He gave Frank the 100 dollars, walked over to his vehicle and opened the trunk. He pulled out an old fashioned wooden Louisville Slugger baseball bat and walked up and looked the elephant in the eye. \n\nA few moments later he walked around behind the elephant, took a stable stance and took a home run swing at the elephants testicles that would have made the Babe proud. The elephant trumpeted out and jumped into the air taking all four feet off the ground. \n\nFrank stood with his mouth gaping open and reluctantly handed the 10 000 dollars to the stranger. The man got into his car and drove off.\n\nA few months later Frank began to get low on funds again. Although his challenge had been won, he had still made a good profit. \n\nBut now he began to try and think of another scam to make even more money, this time, find one that couldn't be accomplished.\nSo Frank came up with a new challenge and once again put it in the newspapers and on T.V. \n\nThis time he was sure of his challenge. He had seen elephants move their heads up and down but because of their anatomy they couldn't move it from left to right, only twist it left and right. Once again a 10,000 dollar prize was offered, and a 100 dollar fee to try.\n\nSo once again people came from far and wide, again even from other countries. Again everything from coaxing to hypnosis to threats were employed but all those who tried failed in their attempt.\n\nOne day a familiar blue convertible pulled into the driveway and a man in a leather jacket got out and approached Frank.\n\n\"Good afternoon sir. Is it true that if I can get your elephant to move his head from left to right, I'll win 10,000 dollars?\"\n\nFrank swallowed hard and replied. \"Afternoon sir, yes it is true but you have to pay 100 dollars per attempt.\"\n\nOnce again the man nodded and agreed. He handed Frank the 100 dollars and once again walked over to his vehicle and opened the trunk. He pulled out the same wooden Louisville Slugger baseball bat, still stained with the elephants blood from the first encounter and walked up to the elephant.\n\nHe paused and looked the elephant in the eye, a few moments later he asked. \"Remember me?\"\n\nThe elephant nodded it's head up and down \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Want me to do it again?\"\n\nThe elephant shook it's head from left to right. \"No.\"",

'I'm dead? No, I can't be! I've got too much to live for.

How's your first day here?'\n\n'Not bad,' replied Ray the hen, 'but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!'\n\n'You're ovulating,' explained the rooster. 'Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before?'\n\n'Never,' said Ray.\n\n'Well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster. 'It's no big deal. He did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg! He was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood.

        "body": "Hey, my name\u2019s Mike Doe, and this is my story. I had a friend in college, my freshman roommate, who was always talking about his family. His name was Robert Gooding, and he must\u2019ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve. Every single day he would drone on and on about some cousin or uncle or some such. He would always burst into the room saying things like, \u201cHey Mike! You\u2019ll never guess Uncle Nate and Aunt Ridley are doing in Taiwan for the orphans this week!\u201d I remember him talking about how Dimitri, his mother\u2019s grandfather\u2019s nephew\u2019s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, had resolved a tense hostage situation in Iran. And how cool Auntie Pauline (actually a distant cousin) was for working on top secret stuff with the CIA. I always tried to be patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories. They never seemed to be about the same people. Sometimes he\u2019d mention something that was actually funny or interesting too so it wasn\u2019t always bad.\n\nGood old rambling Robert. He picked up that nickname within a couple weeks of starting school--I don\u2019t think he liked it much. He didn\u2019t make many friends because he could never stop talking about his own family. Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn\u2019t start running after five minutes. I\u2019m not going to lie though. Back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings. However no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me something new about his family\u2019s latest adventures.\n\nThere was this one time that was different though. On a day close to the end of our first semester together, he suddenly stopped his rambling and stared at me with a really serious expression. The abrupt lack of background noise startled me from the article I was reading while humoring him, and when I saw his face I thought he must have been angry with me for ignoring him. \u201cYou know Michael,\u201d he started as I prepared my apology, \u201cI really appreciate that you listen to my stories every day. I know it must be boring and annoying for you, but you listen anyway and I appreciate that. So I want to promise you something. Us Goodings, we don\u2019t forget stuff like this. We take care of our friends. Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.\u201d I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.\n\nOur year together came to an end, and the next year I was assigned a different roommate. Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when he decided to transfer out to some college in Washington. I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while. I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown, and my mom was so proud to have a real Officer Doe in the family. I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels. It was there that I finally met one of Robert\u2019s infamous family members, Randall Gooding. He was my new supervisor, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend. He told me that he recognized my name and background from the stories Robert had told him, and he personally requested that I be sent down. I was surprised that Robert even talked about me, we had only known each other for a year, but it was nice to reminisce about the Goodings again. Randall was just as talkative as Robert was, and we hit it off almost immediately. It felt like I was in college again. His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy, which had me chuckling for at least a day. Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine. He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.\n\nWork was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically. Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work. Even Randy wasn\u2019t as talkative around this time. It was all supposed to come to a head today. Today we were going to do a massive takedown on a processing plant operating just inside the border. Our undercover agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the other operation. We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and I thought everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.\n\nFrom the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me. They were careful. All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right. All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons--some had guns, some had various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars. The night was rough. They wanted to know how we found out about them, who we were working with, when the operation was going to go down, and a whole host of other questions. I was patient and waited. I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it. While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings. I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building. I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me. I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.\n\nHowever, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance.\u00a0Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped, I thought. My captors were awake in an instant and took up the preplanned positions we had predicted. One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held. After cracking me in the face with the butt of the gun, I felt more than heard him raise the muzzle level with the back of my head. Soon I heard an unfamiliar voice yell over a megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up. Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip. Randy\u2019s voice came over the megaphone just before the first officer continued the negotiation, \u201cMikey! Just wait Mikey! Hang tight and don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\n\nThe standoff lasted for hours. If it weren\u2019t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out from boredom. Eventually things got real quiet. My guard started getting antsy and walked out--probably to check for new orders with his superiors. As soon as he left the room, a hundred glass windows shattered breaking the silence and raining shards of glass down on the main factory floor. White smoke obscured the first floor as tear gas flooded the facility. Shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire. Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn\u2019t tell who was winning. I did hear Randy\u2019s voice at one point yelling orders like, \u201cDimitri, take the stairs and give Pauline some cover.\u201d None of the officers who were supposed to be with us today were named Dimitri or Pauline. The din began to wither after only a few minutes and unseen officers began yelling, \u201cClear!\u201d As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today\u2019s operation. Instead I saw lots of men and a few women I had never seen before in various uniforms.

Thank God you\u2019re still alive. I\u2019m sorry we made you wait so long, but we had to wait for all the flights to make it before we could move.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What flights? Randy, what are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found out you were kidnapped at about midnight. The team that we were going to use wasn\u2019t trained for hostage situations so I had to improvise. I made some calls around and got as many as I could to come down here. Good thing Nate here happened to have hostage experience. Nobody asked any questions after I brought your name up, we all know you thanks to Robert here.\u201d He motioned at the suited man who was leaning in to assess me.\n\nI frowned at the man and suddenly realized that his bag contained medical supplies. \u201cRobert?\u201d I choked the question out in disbelief. He just gave me a small smile while he continued his work. \u201cYou mean to tell me that all of these guys\u2026 They\u2019re all your family?\u201d\n\nRobert looked up from where he was examining my jaw with a wry smile, \u201cI told you we don\u2019t forget Mike.\u00a0All the Goodings come to Doe\u2019s who wait. \u201d",

(Not as much as him, though because NO-ONE loves tractors as much as this guy). But he meets this girl who loves tractors enough to stimulate him, intellectually. \n\nSo fast forward a couple of months and this guy brings his girlfriend to the local field to watch the tractors go by during the sunset. He proposes to her and she says yes. Then they both fall asleep in the field and he has a dream that a tractor was coming to run over him. He wakes and there is a tractor coming towards him! He quickly rolls away but his fianc\u00e9e gets run over and killed.\n\nHe is obviously devastated and swears never to even look at a tractor ever again. So he tears down all his posters and spends all his time in his room, alone and depressed for a few weeks until his mother, again intervenes and gets him to go to the local pub again.\n\nWhen he arrives, the pub is on fire! He rushes in and takes a deep breath, sucking in all the fire and smoke.\n\nThe firemen immediately ask him how he did it. \n\n\"I'm an ex-tractor fan.\"",

We are a tribe of cannibals, and it is our custom to skin you and eat you alive. We use your skins to make our canoes. But we are a modern tribe, so we will grant you one final request.*\n\nThe first explorer thinks: *I don't wanna be skinned alive!* and asks if he can have the pistol from their bags to shoot himself with. \n\nThe chief nods. \n\nThe tribesman rummages through the bag and pulls out the gun and the box of bullets. He takes one bullet out of the box and dumps the rest of the bullets into the river. The first explorer nods farewell to his friends, and blows his brains out. \n\nThe rest of the tribe carries his body away to begin skimming it and the chief turns to the second explorer. \n\nThe second explorer thinks: *I don't wanna be skinned alive! ...but there was only one gun... I've got it!* and asks for the bottle of poison from the poison tipped arrows the tribesman carry. \n\nThe chief nods. \n\nThe tribesman fetches a bottle and the second explorer drinks the whole thing and dies. The tribe members again carry his body off to skin. \n\nThe chief turns to the third explorer who looks him cooly in the eyes. Before the chief says anything the third explorer says: \"I want the mess kit out of our bag.\"\n\nThe chief eyes him suspiciously, but nods. \n\nThe tribesman fetches the mess kit and gives it to the third explorer who opens it up immediately. He takes out the spoon and throws it onto the ground. He takes out the knife, looks at it, and throws it on the ground. Finally, he's left with the fork. \n\nThe third explorer looks at the chief, looks at the tribesman, looks at the tribe. Then, he begins stabbing his chest furiously and yells:\n\n***YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE A CONOE OUTTA ME!!!***",

I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.\"\n\nThe son sat there for a second thinking and said, \"Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball.\" The dad was rather confused by this but decided to go get his son the ball anyways.\n\nAs he was in line to check out with the ball he thought to himself, \"Nah he doesn't actually want a stupid ping pong ball\" so he went and got him an R/C car instead. The son was the happiest kid in the world and was so excited to get his new toy and gave his dad the biggest hug he could and the dad sat there smiling.\n\nA couple years later when the son took standardized tests in elementary school he got a perfect score on every exam and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.\n\nHe went up to his son and said, \"Son, I could never be more proud of you. I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.\"\n\nThe son sat there for a second thinking and said, \"Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball.\" The dad was still confused about his sons request but agreed and left to get the son his ball.\n\nAs he was about to check out with the ping pong ball he thought to himself, \"Nah my son doesn't really want this\" and went back and got him a brand new Xbox.\n\nWhen he got home and gave the present to his son the son was ecstatic and jumped up and down and gave his dad the biggest hug he could and the dad sat there with a smile on his face.\n\nFast forward a couple years and the son is now graduating high school. Top of his class, full ride to whatever school he wanted (Yale for anyone who cares about that detail), graduated with just about every honor you could think of and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.\n\nHe went up to his son and said, \"Son, I could never be more proud of you. I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.\"\n\nThe son sat there for a second thinking and said, \"Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball.\" The dad was yet again confused by his son's odd request but agreed to get the ball.\n\nOn his way to the store the dad passed by a motorcycle dealership and thought to himself, \"Nah my son really doesn't that stupid ping pong ball when he can have a brand new motorcycle.\" And so the dad bought the new bike for his son and the son was the happiest son in the world and gave his dad the biggest hug he could before hopping on the bike. The dad sat there with a smile on his face as he watched his son drive off.\n\nA couple weeks later, the mom and dad are sitting at the table eating lunch when they receive a troubling phone call. As they heard the call both of their faces started to turn pale, the son was in a terrible crash and was not expected to live through the rest of the day. The two rushed down to the hospital as soon as they could and they hurried to their son's room. When they got there they were happy to see the son was still conscious. The parents rushed to either side of the bed and the dad took his son's hand and looked him in the face and said, \"Son, you have been the best child that anyone could ever ask for and I could never be more proud of you.\"\n\nThe son smiled and said, \"Thanks dad.\"\n\n\"I do have one question for you though.\"\n\nThe son looked up at his old man and said, \"Anything for you Dad.\"\n\n\"Why did you always want that pink ping pong ball?\"\n\nThe son smiled and said, \"Well I always wanted it bec-\"\n\nThen he died.\n",

    {
        "body": "There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n\nCoincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n\n\"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n\n\"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would you like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\ntill the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\nhe jumped.\n\nSlowly at first,\n\nbut speeding up,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\nspeeding past Pluto,\n\nand the other outer planets,\n\nthrough the asteroid belt,\n\npast Mars,\n\nand the moon,\n\nfaster,\n\nand faster,\n\nfaster - ever faster,\n\nand by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\npast the albatross,\n\ndouble-back somersault,\n\nand he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,\n\nhurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,\n\nDown on the ship the crew strained their necks,\n\n\"I CAN SEE HIM!\" yelled a passenger, \"LOOK!!!\"\n\nThe tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...\n\nNOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE WATER!\n\nSMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!\n\nDOWN!\n\nDOWN!\n\nTHROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!\n\nTHROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!\n\nAND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!\n\nSTILL DOWN...!\n\nDEEPER,\n\nDEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,\n\nTILL.........\n\nSMASH!\n\nInto the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.\n\nDesperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.\n\nUp and up, desperate, gasping...\n\nOut of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.\n\n\"HERO!\" \"WONDERFUL!\" \"AMAZING!\" \"GOOD SHOW THAT!\"\n\nAnd handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.\n\n\"Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.\"\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see...\n\nI'm a just poor tramp...\n\nso you must understand...\n\nI've been through many a hard ship in my life.\"\n",

The weatherman assured him that there was no chance of rain in the coming days.\nSo the king went fishing with his wife, the queen.\n\nOn the way he met a farmer on his donkey. Upon seeing the king the farmer said, \"Your Majesty, you should return to the palace at once because in just a short time I expect a huge amount of rain to fall in this area\".\nThe king was polite and considerate, he replied: \"I hold the palace meteorologist in high regard. He is an extensively educated and experienced professional, and I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way.\" So they did.\nHowever, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them in such a shameful condition.\n\nFurious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to execute the weatherman at once! He summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying role of royal forecaster.\n\nThe farmer said, \"Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I obtain my information from my donkey. If I see his ears drooping, it means with certainty that it will rain.\" So the King hired the donkey on the spot.\n\nAnd thus began the ancient practice of hiring asses to work in government and occupy its highest and most influential positions..",

He decides to wander the woods near his childhood home. After wandering for a while he comes upon an old,  beat down, shack. It looks empty so he opens the door to explore inside. \"Hello\", a voice greets him from a dark corner. \"I am so sorry! I thought it was abandoned. I'll leave now.\" he replies,  shocked that someone could live here. \"No, no,  please stay a moment. I haven't had company in years.\" the elderly woman says, with a smile. \"Yeah, I guess I can stay, I don't have anywhere else to be.\" the boy says, returning the smile. They talk for a couple hours before teenage boy has to leave to get home for dinner. \"Thank you for being so hospitable. I had a good time\" the young man says to his new friend. \"I am the one who is truly grateful. Please take these as a gift for your time.\" she hands him a pair of ugly, colorful, but clean, socks. \"Thank you?\" he says, confused. \"I can't help you make friends with people your own age but these socks may give you some courage to open up more.\" says the grateful woman. They spend time together at least weekly, and their friendship grows, but the socks remain unused in a drawer. One morning teenage boy has no clean white socks and in a rush to catch the bus put the socks given to him by his elderly friend. When he arrives to school everyone he passes smiles and greets him. \"Odd\", he thinks. At lunch, the popular kids ask him to sit at their table. Before the end of the lunch hour the prettiest cheerleader in school is kissing his cheek. When he gets home he tosses all his other socks out and puts his lucky ones in the wash. The next morning he puts on his socks and gets on the bus. When he gets back to school everything is back to terrible. He is ignored or bullied all day and anxiously awaits the final bell so he can speak to the old woman and get the socks fixed. When he enters her house he sees a massive bear mauling and eating his friend. \"STOP!!! \" He yells. \"I need her help!! Please stop! \" the bear turns to the boy and says.......nothing,  bears don't talk.",

He walks up the four flights of stairs, thinking about how lucky he is to see his wife and drink a cold beer. He reaches his door but finds it locked. He knocks, and as he leans in he hears his wife moaning, along with the sounds of some guy. Well, he goes red with rage and starts pounding on the door. After a minute his wife opens the door, a blanket wrapped around her naked body. \"It's not what you think!\" she screams, but he ignores her, pushing past to see if he can find the guy. The apartment is only one room, with a bathroom off to the side, so there's not a lot of places to hide. The husband looks under the bed, peeks into the shower, but can't find the guy. Then he notices the window is open. He runs over, looks out, and sees a guy in his shorts hanging from the window below him. The husband starts yelling, \"I'll kill you!\", pulling tools off his belt and throwing them at the guy, until the guy suddenly loses his grip and falls. But since the fall is only three stories, when he lands he only breaks his legs. The husband is furious. He looks around for something to throw, and the closest and biggest thing he finds is the fridge. He pulls it to the window and then pushes it out, and it falls right on the guy, killing him instantly. However, in doing this, the husband works himself up so much he has a heart attack and also dies. \n\n\nThe next thing he knows the husband is standing in line at the pearly gates. Saint Peter beckons him forward and asks, \"Well my son, how did you die?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replies the husband \" I came home from a hard day at work and found my wife cheating on me. I was so angry that when I found the guy hanging outside the window I threw things at him until he fell. However, he only broke his legs, and I wasn't satisfied, so instead I grabbed the fridge and pushed it out onto him. But in doing this, I had a heart attack, and here I am.\"\n\n\"Oh boy.\" Replied Saint Peter \"Well, while I'm sad that your wife was not true, it is wrong to kill. I'm afraid you have to go to hell.\" With that, the husband is ushered off to hell. \n\nSaint Peter looks at the next man in line and beckons him forward. \"And how did you die, my son?\"\n\nThe guy looks perplexed. \"It was the strangest thing, sir. I was sitting at home trying to work out, but my apartment is so small I have to be creative and do pull ups outside my window. Well, I was doing this like normal, when all of a sudden a crazy guy starts throwing things at me. I lost my grip and fell, and somehow by God's grace, I didn't die! I started thanking God, but then the guy suddenly pushed out a fridge, and it landed directly on me!\"\n\nSaint Peter scratches his head. \"I am sorry, son. You lived a good life, and as a reward, you get to go to heaven.\" And with that, the guy is ushered to heaven. \n\nSaint Peter beckons the next person in line, who walks up. \"How did you die, my son?\"\n\nThe man replies, \"Well, picture this: You're hiding in a fridge...\"   ",

He would unload all the cookies and make the three-day-long drive back to the factory. He'd been working at the company for years, and was quite reputable.\n\nOne day, he loaded up his trailer and hit the road. After driving for hours, he stopped at a truck stop and inspected his cargo as he normally would, just to make sure everything's okay. When he opened up the doors, there was a hole in one of the packages! He looked around the trailer and his eyes landed on a cookie, walking around the boxes! The driver couldn't believe it, but grabbed the cookie, stuffed it back in the box and taped it shut. \"That should take care of it,\" he thought. After getting a cup of coffee, he started driving again. \n\nWhen he stopped for the night, the driver thought that he better check and make sure that cookie wasn't out of the box again. He opened the doors again, saw the broken box and a cookie doing the Charleston! The driver thought he was going insane, but there it was; a dancing cookie. He brought out the duct tape and sealed the cookie back in the box, then went to bed.\n\nThe next morning, the truck driver woke up a the crack of dawn, thinking that last night's events were only a dream. After getting a bagel and coffee from a restaurant, he started up his truck and hit the road, jamming to the radio. Once he was fully awake, he remembered the cookie and realized it wasn't a dream. Slamming on the brakes, he took the nearest off ramp from the highway, swung the trailer doors open. Lo and behold, the cookie box had a new hole in it, and the cookie was leading a one cookie conga line on top! Furious, the driver snatched the cookie up, crammed it into the box, and covered the entire box in tape. Pleased that he wouldn't have to worry about the cookie again, he kept driving until the sun went down.\n\nOn the third day, after a peaceful night's sleep, the truck driver started on the last leg of the journey to the buyer. He didn't even check the trailer for the cookie, being sure that it couldn't get through the tape. \n\nWhen he finally arrived at his destination, the driver checked in at the office and backed his truck up to the loading dock. As the unloading staff opened the doors, a small brown object fell out of a box. They didn't notice anything until they had unloaded a few boxes; one of the boxes was covered in tape and had a hole in it! Thinking it may have been caused by mice, they called over their supervisor. After taking one look, the supervisor called the driver's company, explained what happened, hung up and spoke two small words to the driver:\n\n\"You're fired.\"\n\nDevastated, the driver didn't know what to do. He grabbed the offending box and stepped back into his eighteen-wheeler and sat there for a minute, in shock. Something caught his eye on the dashboard. It was the cookie, doing the moonwalk. The driver didn't make an effort to put the cookie back into the box, it didn't matter any more.\n\nHe drove to the beach, took the box of cookies, and sat at the end of a pier with the cookie next to him, tap dancing. \"I hope you're happy,\" he said to the cookie. \"You got me fired from a job I worked at for years, a job I was happy doing. Now what am I supposed to do?\" The cookie didn't look at him and kept dancing. The driver became madder and madder. \"You think that's funny? How about THIS?!\" He hollered as he kicked the cookie box and cookie off the dock into the ocean.\n\n**THE** **END**\n\nIsn't that a crumby ending?",

A few weeks go by without  any bites, but one day a man comes in.  The man had a hunched back and no arms, so the bishop was leary of his ability to perform the job, but the Lord teaches love and acceptance of all.  He says to the man, \"if you can climb into the tower and ring the bell, the position is yours.\"  \n\nElated, the armless man runs up the tower stairs, bypassing the rope that one would normally use, but that he was unable to manipulate.  At the top of the stairs, there was ladder to get into the belfry.  Without hesitation, he climbs the ladder using his teeth, and beams as he looks upon the church's bell.  He backs into the corner of the belfry, takes a deep breath, and runs at the bell full speed.  He slams into the bell, it swings and tolls beautifully.   The bishop kept his word and awarded the man the job.\n\nWeeks go by, and all seems right with the world.  The armless man enjoys his new life, but sometimes, he gets a little dizzy tolling the higher hours.  One day, while performing his duty to mark noon, he misses the bell altogether and sails out the far side of the tower.  He falls to his death, and a crowd gathers around the body.  In the general murmur, a voice calls out, \"does anyone know this man?\"  Another replies...\n\n\"No, but his face sure rings a bell!\"\n\nWith a heavy heart, the bishop places out the sign once more, advertising the open position.  Again, weeks pass without a single taker, until another man arrives.  His resemblance to the previous man is uncanny.  A hunched back, no arms, and nearly identical in appearance.  The bishop is dubious, fearful of a repeat of the recent tragedy, but the man falls to his knees, weeping and pleading, and against his better judgement, the bishop makes him the same offer.  The hunchback climbs into the belfry, backs into the corner, runs and tolls the bell, claiming the job.\n\nTo ensure the new ringer's safety, the bishop commissions the installation of bars across the open sides of the tower, and life continues on.  Over the next few years, the hunchback enjoys his life within the cathedral.   He is well cared for, and happy to perform his duty, though the midday ringings do tend to take their toll, and like his predecessor, he misses once in a while, but the bars give him security.  Unfortunately, the bars are not maintained, they rust, and at last, they give.  The armless man tumbles out of the tower and falls to his death.  Once more, a crowd gathers, and again, someone calls out, \"does anyone know this man?\"  And a voice replies...\n\n\"No, but he sure is a dead ringer for his brother!\"",

So they look into the problem, and realise that, although the showers themselves are fast enough, the prisoners actually spend a suspiciously long amount of time drying themselves - causing another possible security threat. The managers then hit on the idea of installing a sort of drying cubicle next to the shower, where each prisoner would enter, be assailed by strong blasts of air from all directions, and be fully dry within half a minute, thus leaving them with no excuse to loiter in the shower.\n\nSo they install these drying boxes for the prisoners, and at first they seem to be a great success. However, although the machines worked, they were so powerful that they caused a lot of noise, even from outside of the boxes, and - this is important - the noise could be heard in the managers' offices. So the managers decided to find another solution, and remove the drying machines, because they couldn't do any work with that cacophony happening every evening.\n\nWhen the technician eventually arrives at the prison to remove the machines, he seems rather reluctant for some reason, but the managers insist he does the deed. However, the moment they are disconnected, there's a massive electricity failure throughout the entire complex, leading to all the prisoners escaping due to lack of electric security systems.\n\nOf course, the managers are outraged, and start shouting at the technician: \"What the hell did you do? I told you to remove those damn drying boxes, not let all the inmates escape!\"\n\nThe technician says, calmly, \"I thought you knew what would happen if those drying machines were removed...\"\n\nThis does nothing to assuage the managers' anger, and they keep demanding an explanation as to why they should have know that there would be a power cut. After several minutes of argument, they finally get one.\n\n\"Don't you remember?\", says the technician. \"The mighty con drier is the powerhouse of the cell...\"",

        "body": "Bob Hill and his new wife Betty were vacationing in Europe, as it happens, near Transylvania. They were driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It was late, and raining very hard. Bob could barely see 20 feet in front of the car. \n\nSuddenly the car skids out of control! Bob attempts to control the car, but to no avail! The car swerves and smashes into a tree. \n\nMoments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees his wife unconscious, with her head bleeding! Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to carry her to the nearest phone. \n\nBob carefully picks his wife up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light. He heads towards the light, which is coming from an old, large house. He approaches the door and knocks. \n\nA minute passes. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob immediately blurts, \"Hello, my name is Bob Hill, and this is my wife Betty. We've been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone??\" \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the hunchback, \"but we don't have a phone. My master is a Doctor; come in and I will get him!\" \n\nBob brings his wife in. An elegant man comes down the stairs. \"I'm afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had a basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory.\" \n\nWith that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. \n\nAfter a brief examination, Igor's master looks worried. \"Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion.\" Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more. \n\nThe Hills' deaths upset Igor's master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. For it is here that he has always found solace. He begins to play, and a stirring, almost haunting, melody fills the house. \n\nMeanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty's hand twitch. Stunned, he watches as Bob's arm begins to rise! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! \n\nUnable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: \n\n\"Master, Master! ... The Hills are alive with the sound of music! ",

The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.\n\n\"Father,\" said the son to this, \"I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. \"A carton of pink ping pong balls?\"\n\n\"A carton of pink ping pong balls,\" the boy confirmed.\n\n\"I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,\" said the father, \"but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.\" And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.\n\n\"Dear son,\" said the father, \"I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?\"\n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. \"Please humour me, dear father.\"\n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. \"Dearest father,\" the son started, \"I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.\" One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.\n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.\n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.\n\n\"Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.\" It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.\n\n\"Father,\" the son said, \"You've made me very happy yet again.\" That night, the son spent on board the tanker.\n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.\n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.\n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. \"My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?\"\n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. \"Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. \"Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.\"\n\n\"Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.\n\n\"Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe son nodded weakly.\n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.\n\n\"Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,\" the father requested.\n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.\n\n\"I-\" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.\n\n\"I- I-\"\n\nThen he died.",

        "body": "he was the original gangster copied a million times over here goes.. his words : Last weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol & Pawn Shop that sparked my interest. The occasion was our 22nd anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife, Toni. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized taser. The effects of the taser were suppose to be short lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety.... WAY TOO COOL!   Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home. I loaded two triple-a batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button AND pressed it against a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arch of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs.   Awesome!!!   Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Toni what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.   Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-a batteries,... right?  \n \nThere I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh & blood moving target. I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised. Am I wrong?   So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, taser in another.\n \nThe directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.   All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5\" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-a batteries) thinking to myself, \"no possible way!\"   What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.....   I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as to say, \"don't do it master,\" reasoning that a one-second burst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.... I decided to give myself a one-second burst just for the heck of it.\n \nI touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION@!@$$!% !@*!!!   I'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs. The cat was standing over me making meowing sounds I had never heard before, licking my face, undoubtedly thinking to herself, \"do it again, do it again!\"   Note: If you ever feel compelled to \"mug\" yourself with a taser, one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one-second burst when you zap yourself. You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor. A three second burst would be considered conservative.   SON-OF-A- ... that hurt like hell!!!\n \nA minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape. My bent reading glasses were on the mantle of the fireplace. How did they get up there??? My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching. My face felt like it had been shot up with Novacaine, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs. I'm still looking for my testicles. I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return.   Still in shock...",

Penguins of all sorts, Emperor Penguins, King Penguins, Little Penguins, African Penguins, all the penguins. \n\nNow, these penguins live all over his house. In his bathtub, sink, toilet, fridge, freezer, penguins everywhere. His house is practically bursting with these penguins.\n\n The mans wife is obviously not impressed with the amount of penguins her husband has.\n\n\"Honey,\" she said to him, \"You have got to get rid of all these penguins. We have no room to live. We can no longer afford to have nice things, not only do the penguins ruin everything we own, but we can hardly afford to feed the penguins. You have to get rid of them.\"\n\n\"I can't do that!\" The man replied. \"I love these penguins. They are like family to me!\"\n\n\"Either they go, or I go!\" She stated.\n\nAfter pondering this ultimatum for a while the man decides that he does, indeed, love his wife more than all his penguins put together. But what to do with all these penguins? \n\n\"Why don't you donate them to the County Zoo?\" His wife asked.\n\n\"Great idea! I'll call them tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Honey, you better call them now. I cannot go one more day with these penguins living here.\"\n\nThe man, saddened by his failed attempt to keep the penguins at least one more day, begrudgingly picks up the phone.\n\n\"Hello, County Zoo, how may I help you?\" Spoke the cheery voice on the phone.\n\n The man took a deep breath and spoke slowly. \n\n\"Hello, I'd like to speak to the person in charge of accepting donations please.\"\n\nThe receptionist on the other end of the line could hear the sadness in his voice. \n\n\"I'll connect you right away sir\" \n\nThe phone was silent for a minute. The man hoped that no one would be connected, that perhaps he could have one last day with the penguins.\n\n\"Hello, County Zoo donation office. How may I assist you?\"\n\n The man's heart sank \"Hello, I have a very large collection of penguins I would like to donate.\"\n\n\"Penguins?\"\n\n\"Yes, penguins.\"\n\n\"Like, real penguins?\"\n\n\"Yes, real penguins.\"\n\n\"That's fantastic!!\" The donation coordinator exclaimed \"We have been trying to get penguins here for a long time! We have an area all set up, but no penguins to live there!\"\n\nThe man smiled to himself. This person seemed very excited to get these penguins. At least they would be going to a happy home and they wouldn't be too far away so he could go visit. \n\n\"My wife says I need to get rid of them today\"\n\n\"Fantastic! Come on down anytime, we will be waiting!\"\n\nIt was settled. The many attached his trailer to his truck and started loading up the penguins. After spending an hour counting the penguins to make sure he had them all the man closed the trailer door and stared to drive to the County Zoo. The man got about halfway there and sure enough he got a flat tire.\n\n\"Damn it!!\" The man thought to himself. \"The County Zoo is almost closed, how will I explain to my wife if I come home with all these penguins.\" \n\nIt was at that point that the man saw another truck coming down the road. He flagged the truck down.\n\n\"Sir you have to help me! I need to get these penguins to the County Zoo. They are about to close soon and my wife will kill me if I don't take these penguins to the County Zoo today.\"\n\n\"You want me to take these penguins to the County Zoo?\" replied the stranger.\n\n\"Yes! Please! I'll pay for you to take them to the County Zoo. How about $500. Is that enough for you to take them?\"\n\nThe stranger took the money.\n\n\"Yeah, that should be enough.\"\n\nSo the two men loaded up the strangers truck with all the penguins and off the stranger went.\n\nAfter a while the man finally got his truck fixed and off he went to the County Zoo. When he got there though the County Zoo was closed. The man started banging on the gate and yelling until a security guard showed up.\n\n\"What is your problem?\" Scoffed the security guard.\n\n\"Please tell me, did my penguins arrive safely, are they all there? May I see them in their new home?\" Pleaded the man.\n\n\"Penguins? We were excepting some penguins, but we never got them.\"\n\n\"WHAT!?!\" The man was furious!! \"That jerk stole all my penguins and my $500 was a rude person!!\"\n\n\"Sorry, sir.\"\n\nThe man needed a way to blow off steam. He decided to drive around for a while before going home to his wife.\n\nAfter, maybe, 30-40 minutes the man sees the stranger from earlier. There he was. Walking down the street with a row of penguins following him, far as the eye can see.\n\nThe man slammed on his breaks.\n\nHe hopped out of his car.\n\nHe approached the stranger and said,\n\n\"Hey! Jerk! How dare you! How dare you steal my $500 and not take the penguins to the County Zoo!\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Said the stranger. I already took them to the County Zoo. I had money left over so I was taking them to the movie theatre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He was a part of people\u2019s lives, from their first prom, to valentines gifts, birthdays, weddings, and even funerals -- he loved his work, and the town loved him. Life for him, his wife Susan, his mom Louis, and their three kids John Jr (JJ), Alexis, and Peter was perfect.\n\nAll that changed though when one day, right across the street, a new shop opened: Holy Brothers Holy Flowers. Intrigued, he went over to introduce himself. Turns out two Friars had recently left their order to open a flower store. They were elderly gentleman who had spent decades tending the garden at their Friary, but ultimately wanted to go live in the outside world. John was friendly, and thought to himself \u201cwell, I\u2019m sure this town can support two florists,\u201d so we went back to his store and thought nothing more of it. \n\nBut as time went on more and more people started going to Holy Flowers. A rumor had gotten started that the flowers were blessed, and that you\u2019d get good luck by going there. Sales dropped for John, money got tight, and he started to accrue debt. Finally, nobody came into his store at all any more.\n\nOne day, out of desperation, he went across the street to talk to the friars. He said \u201cguys, I need you to move your store. My family has owned this place for five generations and I\u2019m going to lose it.\u201d The friars told him to fuck off.\n\nHe went home and told his wife. Thinking a womans touch might help, she went to talk to the friars. \u201cMy family is going to lose our home, please move to the next town over.\u201d She was again told to fuck off.\n\nIn a moment of despair, they sent their children to go plead their case. JJ, Alexis, and Peter went to see the Friars. \u201cPlease sirs, or parents are losing everything, you have to help us out.\u201d They too were told to fuck off.\n\nNext, John\u2019s mother Louis, a kindly, persuasive, but tough woman went to talk to them. She was told to fuck off.\n\nSitting in his dusty empty store John contemplated his failings while he killed a bottle of cheap whiskey. His store, his future, he\u2019s lost all of it. Sitting in a stupor, a thought drifted into his mind. He remembered an old family \u2013 acquaintance. He picked up the phone and called the man, a huge (probably former felon) guy named Hugh. Nobody knew exactly what Hugh did, but he wasn\u2019t a good guy. John\u2019s dad had done Hugh a favor once so they were in his good graces, but this was a man to be respected and feared. \n\nJohn explained the situation to Hugh over the phone, who simply said \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it\u201d and hung up the phone. \n\nTwo days later Holy Flowers closed. No explanation, no closing sale, the just shut their doors, drove out of town as fast as they could, leaving everything behind. Customers started coming back to John, and he lived happily ever after.\n\nThe moral of the story? Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.",

Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine?'\"\n\n\nClyde said, \"Well, I had just got Bessie into the trailer and I was driving down the road.\"\n\n\nThe lawyer interrupted again and said \"Judge, I'm trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the highway patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.\"\n\n\nBy this time the judge was fairly interested in Clyde's answer and said to the lawyer \"I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule, Bessie.\"\n\n\nClyde thanked the judge and proceeded.\n\n\n\"Well as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the trailer and was driving down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.\n\n\nWhen the highway patrolman came on the scene he could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her and saw her near fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.\n\n\nThen the patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me and said, 'how are you feeling?'\n\n\nNow what the fuck would you say?\"",

I was glad , I couldn\u2019t believe myself. I was glad that my best friend cared this deeply about my wife, and I was glad that my wife loved my best friend this much, I was incredebally happy !!  I could now surprise them together in my own bed room !! As I unlocked my house doors, I was careful not to make a sound and wake them up, and as I walked closer to my bed room, I saw two plates in the dining area, and I opened my bed room door as slowly as I could.\n\nI was correct \u2026 My best friend was sleeping in the warm embrace of my wife, and it was so \u2026 cute, but as I took another step, the floor board creaked and my friend who had a keen ear looked around and saw me. For a moment he did not know what to do, but the very next he jolted towards me; and in the process woke my wife up. When he got close enough, he put his hands on my chest and stared kissing my all over my face, and my wife looked sheepishly at us and fell onto the bed cheekily whilst opening her arms for a hug and said \u201c I missed you ... \u201c. \n\nI kissed my friend and went over to my wife and said, \u201c You know, I knew that you\u2019d be with him, and I love the both of you for that\u201d, while hugging her. My best friend joined in on the hug and I decided at that moment that he\u2019d move in with us and would have dinner with us every night. He was now **our** best friend and the good-est boy we have ever known. We were one big happy family...\n\ntl;dr: The devil is in the detail.\n",

Jim got out the fruits he brought, and Maximilian carefully took out his lasagna while the three were engaging in small talk. \"Beautiful day, right Tim?\" said Jim, as Tim murmured a soft yes while frantically searching in his giant bag. Maximilian noticed something was wrong, and asked \"What's the matter, Tim?\" Tim said, \"I made six Cubanos this morning, I see only two.\" Maximilian responded, \"Don't worry, we can manage with two and what we've got here.\" Tim anxiously said, \"No you don't understand, I spent an awful lot of time learning how to make these and spent the whole night yesterday and morning today so I could get these right.\" Jim: \"Tim, you've been through a lot this week, you should've taken some rest instead. Take a seat, no worries we'll share.\"\n\n\"Shut the fuck up,\" came the blunt response from Tim as he almost dove into his bag desperately trying to find his remaining four Cubanos. A concerned Maximilian commented, \"This guy really needs to chill, he's taking this way too seriously.\" Tim snapped, and he jumped on Maximilian and brutally beat him up, before stepping on his face until he was bleeding profusely and unable to move. A shocked Jim took two steps back before charging at Tim, who tackled him and immediately threw him to the ground and delivered some hard punches to Jim's stomach before smashing a glass bottle on his head, leaving him unconscious. Just as Maximilian recovered, Tim held him to the tree and stabbed him with the broken glass bottle.

He falls 19 floors and hits the ground, but he's still squirming. So I go to the kitchen and push my fridge over to the balcony and over the railing. It nails the guy. I turn around and go to yell at my wife when I die of a heart attack.\"\n\nSP \"You poor man! Go have an extra day\"\n\nWell now the second soul is approaching the  Gates, so St. Peter says \"My son, tell me about your last day on Earth\"\n\nSecond Guy \"St. Peter my last day was AWFUL! So I'm gardening on the 20th floor of my apartment building when I lose my balance and fall. Thankfully I managed to catch the railing right below my balcony.  When out of nowhere this lunatic appears and starts kicking my hands and screaming something about sleeping with his wife. I fall from the balcony, and the last thing I remember seeing is a fridge falling towards me.\"\n\nSP *snickering* \"Go have your day!\"\n\nA third soul is approaching the Gates so St. Peter says. \"My son, tell me about your last day on Earth\"\n\nThird Guy \"So I'm naked in a fridge....\"",

Carol's mother, been a Christian woman, wanted her to reflect on her behavior over the last year, and write a letter to God and tell him why she deserved a bike for her birthday.

He could make very off-the-wall predictions, and he had a knack for making money off them.\n\nOne day, a shipmate finds him making a small X on the deck with tape, and asks what he's doing. John stands up. \"I'll bet you fifty bucks, in exactly an hour a seagull will fly over, and shit exactly on this spot.\" The other man laughs, says \"You're on!\", and they shake on it.\n\nThey both come back to the deck close to an hour later. After a few minutes, sure enough, they hear the calls of a gull, followed by a faint splat. The salior looks down in disbelief at the pile of bird shit on the center of the tape. He pays up.\n\nA couple of days pass. It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky. Back on the deck, another salior finds John walking around in his rain coat, and asks why he's wearing such odd attire on such a pretty day. \"I'll bet you 100 dollars that you're gonna regret not wearing yours too in just a minute.\" The second man looks at him, and takes the bet. He begins to walk away, but before he can take a dozen steps, a single dark cloud forms in the sky and begins to soak the entire ship. \n\nThese strange bets continue, and before long, news reaches the captain of the ship. He wants this madman off his boat. He calls some friends in high places, and gets John transfered to another vessel. A few days later, he receives a phone call from the commander of the destroyer John was placed on.\n\n\"You know,\" says the commander, \"I don't see why you wanted him gone so bad. I've already won five thousand from him. He's not as good as you said.\"\n\n\"What? How'd you pull that off?\"\n\nThe commander laughs. \"The idiot bet me that I had hemorrhoids! I've never had them in my life, easy money! It was a little awkward proving it, but worth it.\"\n\n\"How'd you prove it?\"\n\n\"Simple. I pulled down my pants, and showed him my asshole. He still didn't believe me, so he grabbed a broom and poked at me, and finally was convinced. Easiest five grand I've ever made.\"\n\nThere was a silence, and the captain finally said, \"Throw that son of a bitch overboard right now.\"\n\n\"What? Why?\" asked the commander.\n\n\"Because on his last day before the transfer, he bet me twenty thousand that he'd willingly have a broomstick up your ass by the end of the first week.\"",

The officer in charge soon noticed that Ole was getting a 99% sign-up rate for the more expensive supplemental form of GI insurance.\n \nThis was remarkable, because it cost these low-income recruits $30 per month for the higher coverage, compared to what the government was already providing at no charge. The officer decided he'd sit in the back of the room at the next briefing and observe Ole's sales pitch.\n \nOle stood up before the latest group of inductees and said\u2026\"If you haf da normal GI insurans an' yoo go to Afghanistan an' get yourself killed, da governmen' pays yer beneficiary $20,000.

The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, \"Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?\" The blond replies.....\"Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?\"",

Just give it a urine sample and the computer'll tell you what's wrong and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor.\" \n\nSo Jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore. He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits. \n\nTen seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks. \n\nThat evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure. \n\nJack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results. \n\nThe computer prints the following:\n \n1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. \n2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. \n3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab. \n4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. \n5.

The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.\n\nThe next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.\nThe battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.\n\nAnd it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",

She insisted that she must speak with the president of the bank to open a savings account because, \"It's a lot of money!\" After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff finally ushered her into the president's office.\n\nThe bank president then asked her how much she would like to deposit. She replied, \"$165,000!\" and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk. The president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, \"Madam, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. Where did you get this money?\" The old lady replied, \"I make bets.\" The president then asked, \"Bets? What kind of bets?\" The old woman said, \"Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.\" The president laughs, \"That's a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!\" The old lady challenged, \"So, would you like to take my bet?\" The president agrees, \"Sure, I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't square!\" The little old lady then said, \"Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10am as a witness?\"\n\"Sure!\" replied the confident president.\n\nThat night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet. The next morning, at precisely 10am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office.\n\nShe introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet \"$25,000 says the president's balls are square!\" The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. \"Well, Okay,\" said the president, \"$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.\"\n\nJust then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The president asked the old lady, \"What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?\" She replied, \"Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10am today I'd have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hand.\"",

There was a massive bear that paraded the shores on both sides and this made fishing difficult for both villages that lie on opposite sides of the river. \n\nEarlier there used to be a small pack of wolves that paraded the shores and now they were forced in the villages because of the bear. This posed a problem as they started attacking the livestock. The village elders decided to meet on the high bridge that connected them together to see who can help with this situation. \n\nWhen the elders met on the bridge, with all the other villagers in tow, they argued for an hour and didn't reach any conclusion. Then when all hope was about to be lost, Peter jumped from the bridge in the river. Having witnessed this the bear rushed to kill him. The villagers looked at this in awe from above. \n\nPeter somehow swims on the shore and smacks the head of the prancing bear with a large stone. The bear drops dead. Having witnessed that the bear is out of the way, the wolves run down and start attacking Peter. But one by one, Peter takes them all out. \n\nHaving seen all this, the villagers start to celebrate as Peter comes to meet the elders. Everyone is congratulating him on his bravery but Peter looked unfazed by all this. \n\nOne of the elders comes to him and says, \"Peter, for this bravery, all of us have decided that we'll offer you something big, what do you want? A house? A really pretty wife? A field? You say it and we'll give it to you!!\" \n\nTo this Peter replies, \"I only want one thing, I wanna know which motherf**er pushed me off the bridge!!\" ",

The donkey came in 3rd. The next Day the daily racing form carried the headline:\n\n**\u201cPreachers Ass Shows\u201d**\n\nThe Preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again. This time he won. The form read:\n\n**\u201cPreachers Ass Out in Front\u201d**\n\n The Bishop was upset with this kind of publicity and he ordered the preacher not to enter his donkey in another race. The newspaper headline read:\n\n**\u201cBishop Scratches Preachers Ass\u201d**\n\nThis was too much for the bishop and he ordered the preacher to get rid of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a nearby convent. The newspaper headline read:\n\n**\u201cNun Has Best Ass in Town\u201d**\n\nThe Bishop fainted; He informed the nun that she would have to dispose of the donkey. She finally found a farmer who was willing to buy the donkey for $10.

Instead of a band of gorillas, just two. The rest of the zoo animals were just as sparse.\n\nOne day during a thunder and lightning storm, a single bolt of lightning struck the two remaining gorillas and killed them both instantly. Thankfully due to the storm, there were no people visiting the zoo and so the general public wasnt aware of the tragedy. The head zookeeper pulled a staff member aside and said \"Hey, I've got a gorilla suit in the back. Why dont you put it on every day, get in the habitat and act like a gorilla and I'll see that you get paid an extra $50 a day.\"\n\nThe staff member agreed, and everything seemed to be working out fine. The public thought it was an authentic gorilla, the staff member made an extra $50 a day and the zoo didnt have to go through the trouble of finding a new gorilla plus deal with the financial hassle of maintaining a real animal.\n\nThe staff member realized one day that he could swing on the artificial vines on the tree in the habitat. He got quite good at it, and would at times swing out so far that he would leave the gorilla enclosure. The head zookeeper didnt care because he knew the gorilla was really a man in a gorilla suit, so he let it continue. The public loved it, thinking that a real gorilla was actually getting out of the enclosure, it heightened their sense of enjoyment.\n\nOne fateful day, when the staff member gave a particularly vigorous swing, his momentum carried him quite far out of the range of the gorilla enclosure. In fact, he realized he was directly over the lion habitat. At that moment, the artifical vine snapped, and he tumbled down through the air. He landed flat on his back, knocking the wind out of him.\n\nThe lone lion saw the gorilla fall, and sprang over with a roar. The man in the gorilla suit was terrified, and as his breath returned to him, he began to yell for help. \"SAVE ME!!! I'M NOT A REAL GORILLA!!!\" he yelled. At that moment, the lion moved his jaws towards the monkey head, opened his mouth and said...\n\n\"Shut up you idiot, or we will both lose our jobs!\"",

As they began the lesson, the muggle-born student struggled with one of the spells. He was reading it straight from his second-hand book, but his wand just wasn't responding as it should. It would spew yellow flames in all directions, repeatedly striking the bells in the tall clock in the corner or even landing in the ink wells on the desks, sizzling as the flames sputtered out. After searing his eyebrows for the 3rd time, he raised his hand for the professor to come over and help him. She looks over his shoulder, sees the writing in his book, and immediately recognizes the issue. The previous owner had spilled some tea on the pages and had attempted to re-write some of the words where the ink had faded. The result? Miss Pell's spell was misspelled, causing a mis-spell from hell for the bells and the wells.",

        "body": "By the 15th century, the Templar Knights had disappeared, but deep in the bowels of the British Museum in a case well sealed and protected lies a strange memorial to their impact on the city of London.\n\nLondon of the early 12th century was on its way to becoming an impressive city, but its life and its blood was the Thames River. Without the river commerce would grind to a halt as the people of London discovered to their horror in 1216.\n\nThe first ships seemed simply to have disappeared, but the monster wasted little time in this caution. Soon, many Londoners had seen the gaping maw licked by flames dragging a hapless crew to its death. It was a fire salamander, and in the Autumn of 1216 it was estimated to be 40 feet long with jaws that gaped 10 feet wide.\n\nBy the spring of 1217, the monster was no longer a nuisance, it was a deadly plague. No boat could navigate the Thames\u2026 no raft was small enough, no ship was large enough to resist the demon of the Thames. Worse, the beast was growing! The latest reports called it 70 feet long with jaws opening 15 feet. Our instinct is to discount this absurd growth, and yet few could impeach its source.\n\nHe, our source, enters the story in August of 1217. London had begged, prayed, blasphemed, and killed in desperate attempts to exorcise or appease their curse; to no avail. On June 14, four men painted themselves with the Devil\u2019s Cross and proclaimed themselves the Dark Priests of the Beast. They built a ship and doused it in oil; then, they sailed it down the river. Dark Priests they may have been, but they died screaming like any man. On July 28, London sent three virgins (the youngest not yet 13) down the Thames to the monster. It was thought that this would appease the evil god: the monster\u2019s hunger exceeded even this atrocity.\n\nOn August 23, our source received his summons. His given name is lost in his chosen name: Honorus. He was a Templar Knight and possibly a saint. That morning, he was commanded to destroy the beast.\n\nLondon in fear and desperation had turned to their most jealous weapon, the Templars\u2026 warrior monks who fought with the fierce, perhaps fanatic, frenzy of the devout. The city had exhausted all other options; the monks were its last hope, and Honorus was the greatest of the Knights.\n\nThe battle was truly a footnote to his preparation\u2026 Honorus ventured into the woods upstream from London. He forsook shelter, clothing, food, and sleep for four days, meditating on the coming struggle. When the four days ended, he stalked and killed a stag without weapon or aid. With the skin of the stag he made clothing; from its flesh he regained his strength; and with its guts, he lashed five logs into a raft fit for his purpose.\n\nHonorus set the raft in motion. He had outfitted himself with the only item he would use in this fight which had not come out of the forest with him. A sword of Spanish steel, blue with the sky, lay in his lap. Soon, he felt the swell of the water disturb his raft: the monster was coming, yet he sat unmoving.\n\nThe beast broke the surface.\n\nNo human is perfect; a splinter of the collapsing raft clipped Honorus\u2019 left foot as he leapt into the water. He had timed his jump slightly too late, but no matter, the injury will not be important until after the battle.\n\nThe monster was above the water only momentarily; time enough for Honorus to drive his sword between two of its scales. The monster thrashed in pain, turning its exposed flesh from the steaming water. Honorus was lifted from the water as the beast rolled. He gauged his stroke and leapt, striking the monster\u2019s eye.\n\nAngered and half blinded, the beast threw Honorus into the river and grasped him in its immense jaws. Honorus swam quickly past the teeth into the monster\u2019s mouth. Inside, the questing tongue scalded his feet as he searched for purchase again, and we shall ignore this injury for now.\n\nOnce he had braced himself inside the beast\u2019s mouth, pushing with all his strength against the slowly rising tongue, he took aim. Honorus had time to make only one thrust.\n\nWhen his journal recalls these events, it attributes Honorus\u2019 \u201cluck\u201d in this battle to aid from the Divine. We do not wish to detract from the glory of God, but surely He will not envy His servant. Is it coincidence that Honorus\u2019 blade struck true to the brain? Honorus had already studied carefully the anatomy of the salamander a week before he was summoned to fight the beast. Did Honorus not know that the water\u2019s rush against the beast\u2019s exposed flank would cause it such pain? In his journal, \u201cAugust 24: And once I am atop the beast and it has rolled from the water, where then to strike?\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after Honorus was told to lift the curse of London, the beast was dead. The next day London celebrated Honorus; the town would live because of him. Three days later, gratitude had disappeared.\n\nThe body of the beast had lodged itself firmly in the mire less than half a mile downstream of London. Although it was yet intact (perhaps due to its incredible armor), it would surely soon rot. While not so great a terror, the rotting beast would be almost as dangerous as the live beast, attracting disease and scavengers. No ship could move the carcass. The people of London called upon Honorus.\n\nHonorus\u2019 solution was difficult but practical, and he began as soon as he had retrieved his sword. He fasted for two days; then, he ate the cooked meat of the huge salamander and fasted for a third day. When he suffered no ill effects, Honorus began dissecting the beast. With the help of London, Honorus soon had all the usable meat and intestines of the dead beast transformed into sausage.\n\nA bizarre solution it was, but a good one. The sausage was soon discovered to be excellent and to keep easily for very long periods of time. Even more important, the sausage fast became incredibly popular throughout England and much of Europe. It began to reestablish the fame of London\u2019s trade after the Hiatus of the Beast.\n\nStill, Honorus has one final contribution to this history\u2026 It became vital that everyone knew from whence the incredible sausage of London came, and thus we return to Honorus\u2019 injuries.\n\nAfter the battle with the live beast and the crisis of the dead beast, Honorus took time to recover. Six weeks after he was first summoned, he was dressing the injuries on his feet. The problems of London were known to him. As he dipped a strip of paper like gauze into a healing salve, he had a thought.\n\nOne week later, each sausage shipped from London carried a fascinating new development: a label. Just as the gauze dried and closed on Honorus\u2019 foot, the parchment around these sausages was attached; and all would know the fame of London from each link she sold.\n\nIn the end, despite all his other feats, it was this idea, the product label, that survived Honorus. In tribute to this advance, the British Museum houses the only known surviving label from Honorus\u2019 sausages. And although even the tough gut of the Beast has long since faded to dust, the label may still be read. If our reader could go to the Museum and enter the Medieval wing\u2019s most treasured collection, she could still read, in faint letters, the Label of Honor:\u2026 It Was The Beast Of Thames, It Was The Wurst Of Thames\u2026",

        "body": "Here it is, the one that started r/feghoot.\n\nSo a man is on a business trip through Romania. He had missed the train and so had to take his car instead. His car was around 20 years old and was not really up to the trip, but needing to close a deal for his company, he was determined to make it there on time.\n\nSo he started to drive down the highway. He spent an hour or so on the freeway and things were going well but he saw ahead there was a large backup in traffic. Not knowing how long this jam would take he uses his phone's gps to find an alternate route.\n\nHe exits the freeway and starts down a long two lane road that began to wind through the mountains. After many miles he begins to question weather this was really the best road he could have taken, but the gps said that in another 30 miles he would re-join the highway, so he continued on.\n\nAs he was driving he encountered a very steep climb up through a mountain pass. As he reached the top he heard a loud bang and the vehicle shook violently. He coasted just enough to make it over the pass and start downhill. He stopped at the peak of the climb and opened up the hood and being not very mechanically inclined, he had no idea what was wrong.\n\nHe got back in the car and tried to start the car but it just would not start. So he decided to try and coast down the hill and see how far he could get, or possibly come across a petrol station.\n\nHe coasted down the hill for almost a full mile and as it flattened out, slowly the car rolled to a halt. Having seen nothing within the Last ten miles he decides to try and call a towing company to get his car, but his phone has no signal and is almost dead.\n\nSo having seen nothing in the last 20 miles, he decides to lock his car and continue on foot to see if he can find someone with a phone.\n\nHe continues on foot for several miles till he sees a small driveway which shows no signs of recent use. He decides it's worth a shot to go check this out. He walks down this driveway for at least half a mile before he finds a massive iron gate connected to a large stone wall on each side. As he approaches the gate, the gate creaks and squeaks and slowly opens inward.\n\nA bit startled, he cautiously walks through the gate and continues down the path. He hears a noise behind him and he turns to see the gate slowly swing shut and close with a loud bang. The man jumps at the sound and decides this wasn't the best idea, so he runs quickly back to the gate, but it is shut and refuses to open.\n\nHe decides to continue on and go find the house on this property. He walks for another 5 minutes before seeing a massive mansion looming in front of him. The front doors must have been 20 feet tall, and there were hundreds of windows and it was 8 stories tall with a tower on the far right side of the house.\n\nThe man slowly walks up the massive stone steps and through the huge pillars and right up to the large wooden doors. He finds the courage to grab the massive lions head knocker and knock on the door. Supprisingly quickly a short man in a butlers uniform opens the door.\n\n\"can I help you?\" asks the butler\n\n\"yes I was looking for a telephone. My car broke down and I don't have cell signal and...\"\n\n\"follow me.\" said the butler, sternly cutting him off.\n\nHe follows the small butler into the largest foyer he has ever seen with rich thick red carpets on the floor and gigantic iron chandeliers hanging from a ceiling so high it reminded him of a Gothic cathedral he had seen many years ago in Italy.\n\nThe butler shows him the telephone and telephone book and leaves him to call the towing company. The towing company is quite busy and because of the distance to his car from any major town, they are not able to send a truck till the next morning.\n\n\"what did they say?\" asked the butler.\n\n\"they can't send a truck till tomorrow. Is there a chance I could mayb...\"\n\n\"Right this way, we have many guest bedrooms.\" says the butler cutting him off again.\n\nHe follows the butler down a long hallway lined with suits of armour and shields with different coats of arms.\n\n\"geez,\" says the man, chuckling to himself, \"do you have talking teacups and a monster for a Master?\"\n\nThe butler responded with silence as he continued to lead him through the mansion. Finally, after what seemed like ages, they reached a lavishly decorated bedroom with a large four post bedroom and a Supprisingly large and modern bathroom.\n\n\"we have a full buffet just down at the end of the hall to your right, but before anything else, I need to show you something.\"\n\nThe butler then takes him back to the main foyer. He walks up to a giant Fireplace. He pushes on a big stone on the corner of the hearth and the back wall of the fireplace slides away to reveal a passage. He walks down this passage turns a corner goes down a set of stairs around another corner, back up some stairs and through a large door with a big brass knob.\n\nIn the middle of the room was a big cage with a pink gorilla sitting in one corner.\n\n\"you must never touch the pink gorilla!\" said the butler as he quickly turned and ushered the man back through the doorway, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs, around the corner, down the hallway and out the fireplace.\n\nThe butler then quickly walked away and disappeared through a door that then locked.\n\nNot sure what to think, the man goes back to his room and takes a long shower. After his shower, he goes to bed and tries to sleep, but he can't stop thinking about the pink gorilla. Why would that butler even show him the gorilla? It's not like he would have found the cage by accident.\n\nHe eventually decides he wants to go take another look. not to touch, but just to look. He had been going over the image of that gorilla in his mind and he couldn't decide if what he saw was real or not.\n\nSo he crept out of his room and down to the foyer. The fireplace was closed and he knew he would have to push the secret rock, but he didn't want to alert the butler or anyone else in the house. He tries to carefully push the button, making as little noise as possi...\n\nSHHHOOOK BAM!\n\nHe froze and looked around to see if the loud noise woke anyone. Luckily it seems that no one heard or cared and so he slowly entered through the fireplace and walked slowly down the hallway. He went around the corner at the end of the hallway, down the stairs, around the other corner, up the stairs and then slowly turned the big brass doorknob.\n\nThe door opened with a loud creak and revealed the large cage with the pink gorilla now sitting in a different corner. He slowly walked around the cage untill he was at a point where the gorilla was a mere arms length from the cage bars. The pink gorilla was sitting there snoring, sleeping like a baby. By this time, the man had decided he had to find out what would happen if he touched the gorilla. So he slowly reached in the cage and softly poked the gorilla in the arm. He stood there waiting for the gorilla to react but nothing happened. So he reached out and poked the gorilla a bit harder. This time the gorilla moved to scratch the spot he had touched.\n\nThe gorilla then awoke. Sniffing his arm he uttered a low guttural growl. The man quickly withdrew his arm and headed for the door. The gorilla then released a long loud cry and started going crazy at the bars of the cage. He started actually bending the bars, getting it close to where he could actually get out. Then he ripped one of the bard off and howled again. At this point, the man, terrified, started sprinting out the door. He ran as fast as he could, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs. As he reached the top step he could hear the gorilla starting down the stairs behind him. He ran even faster down the hallway and out the fireplace.\n\nHe frantically started mashing the secret stone to get the fireplace to close. And as if in slow motion the back began to slide back in place. It moved so slowly that the man wasn't sure it would close in time. As bit was half closed he saw the gorilla round the last corner. In a mad hope to get it to close faster he started mashing the button again but to no avail.\n\nJust as the massive stone was about to close the gorilla puts his hand in the small Crack left open. He slowly started pulling the large stone wall back open. Terrified, the man ran out the front door and sprinted back down the driveway. He came to the iron gate and again it wouldn't open for him. So he began to climb.\n\nHe got to the top and as he climbed over he heard the gorilla's cry and being so startled he fell down on the other side of the gate tearing his new clothes in the process. He stumbled down the driveway towards the main road and as he looked back he saw the gorilla climbing up the gate.\n\nRunning as hard as he could he ran back to the main road and then back towards his car, the gorilla not far behind. He finally reaches his car exhausted, he tries to start his car but it just won't start. The gorilla running up to the car as he tries again to start the car. The gorilla roars and the man reaches over and pushes down the lock by his shoulder and tries again in vain to start the car.\n\nThe gorilla then starts to push and rock the car, violently shaking the car. He eventually rips off the driver side door. The gorilla then leans down and roars right in the man's cowering head, spewing phlegm all over his face and shoulders. The gorilla then reaches his arm into the car and pokes the man in the shoulder and says,\n\n\"you're it.\"",

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n\"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n\nSo the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"\n\nEDIT: if you liked this joke, go to r/feghoot for more like this one!\n\nEDIT 2: To people screaming repost, i gave credit to  u/insolent_swine in the comments.

He had tried many methods, including nets, spears, and traps, but all to no avail.\n\nFurthermore, he was looked down upon by the rest of his family. While he should have been heir to the throne, he spent so much time trying to fish and failing that he was unsuited to the position. Furthermore, he had hardly wanted to become king anyway, and saw no real need for him to fill the position. Eventually, his family disowned him and he had to live his own life in a small hut.\n\nOne day, he met an old man by the lake shore, who was hungry and begging. The prince was down to his last few coins in his purse, but he gave them to the old man anyway. Not entirely out of altruism, mind you. He simply thought the old man would be able to have more use with the money than he would, considering what a failure he was at fishing.\n\nThe old man looked up at him and smiled, asking him \"I see you have a fishing net. Would you like to learn the secret to fishing?\"\n\nThe prince, obviously just having given away absolutely everything, had little choice but to agree. So obviously, he did.\n\nThe old man told him, \"Come closer.\"\n\nThe prince did so.\n\nThe old man whispered in his ear, \"Beyond the desert to the east is a huge ocean where the water is sweet and bubbling. Many fish swim in it, for there are plenty of nutrients in the water. You will surely get some fish there.\"\n\nThe prince said, \"I understand,\" and started to set off.\n\nThe old man called after him, \"Wait, you'll need this!\" and gave the prince a fishing pole.\n\n\"This fishing pole is enchanted. It will draw fish towards it. You'll see.\"\n\nThe prince scrounged up what he could for the journey. He took the last of the bread he had, some water from the lake, and left his hut abandoned.\n\nHe started crossing the desert. The blistering heat beat down on him. Halfway through the desert, he noticed someone was following him. He turned towards them and asked if they had brought any water with them.\n\n\"Yes, but you haven't kept up your interest payments. Pay me and I'll throw in the water as a free bonus. Otherwise, I guess you won't be needing your left hand.\"\n\nTrue to the old man's word, the fishing rod had indeed attracted a loan-shark (though the prince didn't realize this at the time). Not wanting to be killed or tortured or whatnot, the prince quickly thought up a plan.\n\n\"Yes, it's right here,\" he said, rummaging through his bag.\n\nHe took out the stale bread, which had hardened to a brick, and threw it at the shark, stunning him for a moment.\n\nHe turned and fled, running through the desert. His throat was parching, and every step he took against the slippery sands seemed to resist him all the way. Meanwhile, the loan-shark was calmly walking towards him.\n\nSomehow, the prince managed to outrun the loan-shark. He made it to the edge of the bubbling ocean, as the old man had predicted. There, he saw a boat with some fishing supplies in them. He climbed in and started to figure out how to use the fishing rod.\n\nTrue to the old man's word, the moment he cast his hook into the bubbling, fizzy waters, strange fish did indeed start biting almost immediately. He ended pulling fish after fish after hefty fish into his boat; so much so that he almost capsized. But in the end, he rowed back to shore, and thought that he should set up his home here.\n\nHe built a fire, cooked one of the fish, and took a bite out of it.\n\nIt was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted.\n\nSeveral months passed, and the prince was able to live a happy life. Many travellers who passed by enjoyed his fish and paid a high price for it. So much so, that he eventually started up a trading company specializing in the fish. Then people wanted to be employed, so he had to build houses for them too. The prince's company soon turned into a town, into a city, and he had almost supreme authority.\n\nOne day, however, the aforementioned loan-shark arrived at the new palace. He was shown the way to the prince (who was basically now king but didn't realize it), and said \"Now that you're king, you can pay me all that money you owed! Remember, of course that the rate was normally 8% per month, but since you're a king, it's 8% per day!\"\n\nThe prince, realizing what had happened, fell to his knees and cried:\n\n\"Is this the reel life? Is this just Fanta sea?\nCaught in sand, lied; no escape from regality\"",

Do you think I could stay the night?\"\n\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a beautiful sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.\n\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.\n\nYears later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.\n\nThe monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\nThe man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"\n\nThe man sets about his task. \n\nAfter years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\n\n\"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\"\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\"\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.\n\nFinally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"\n\nThe man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!\nWith trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nBut, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

But the weight was still piling on and getting worse. So even though it was making me sick I forced myself to eat a few spoonfuls a day, and eventually worked it up to two sticks a day. I got diarrhea regularly and I thought maybe it was working, but the scale and mirror told me it wasn't. Around six months in something changed in my body, and I stopped getting sick. Eating butter started to feel really comforting. I thought it was good, but the fat kept coming.\n\nThen I'm crying about the weight a few days later, so I go back to the friend's post, and it actually said...\n\n\"Eat better.\"",

She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.\n \nAfter many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.\n \nThe president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.\n \nThe president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.\n \nThe president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'\n \nThe elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'\n \nThe president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.         \nThe woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'\n \n'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'\n \n'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.\n \nThat night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.\n \nThe next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square.\n \nThe president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.\n \nThe president was happy to oblige.\n \nThe elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked   the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'\n \nThe elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland.'",

But I have only 3 wishes to give!\" Shouts the Genie. \"I will give each of you 1 wish, choose wisely!\"\n\nEnrique speaks up first, \"Oh magical Genie! I'd like Mexico to become a wealthy and strong nation! I want to be able to provide for our people and keep them safe from the Cartels! I want the economy in our country to be strong enough that families need not leave in order to find jobs. I want Mexican culture to flourish such that people are proud to be Mexican and can come home and celebrate with all of their friends and family!\"\n\n*Poof* - and just like that, the Mexican Peso surges past the US Dollar, and all the Mexican immigrants in America are rushing back to Mexico to work more lucrative jobs. Even now in fact, some Americans are illegally crossing the border trying to get jobs in the new world economic superpower. \n\nMalala goes next. \"Genie, please! I wish that there was peace in the middle east! That all of Pakistan, India, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya... All of it! I wish that everyone could come to their senses and stop fighting for power, and instead work towards bettering their own societies. Education and equality for all, men, women, and children! Allow those of any  faith, be that Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, whatever they wish to believe - allow them to live harmoniously together and bring about a peaceful revolution to world. \n\n*Poof* - and just like that, all across the middle east a sense of calm crosses the land. People set aside their differences and come to understand one another. New glorious Multi-faith temples arise that attract pilgrims and tourists, and Schools and Universities spring up all over - creating a new intellectual hub of the world. People from all over are trying to get into these prestigious schools to learn from the greatest minds, and this open and safe mix of cultures creates a near utopia like region of the globe.\n\nLast is Donald Trump. As he's checking his twitter and other online news feeds, he sees that America has fallen from great heights. All of the low-income workforce has left the country, and those with the means to leave the country have done so to move on to greener pastures. What's left is a mess of those too impoverished to leave or too proud or uneducated to see why they should.\n\nDonald Trump takes a look at all of this, then turns to the genie and says, \"Well, so long as the Mexicans and Muslims are gone, I'll just take a Pepsi.\" ",

Well, Miss, we were out for a walk and it started to rain so hard that we all got soaked instantly, and this is a picture of the rain. Very good Jimmy says the teacher.   \nNext up to the board was Sally. Sally drew a series of jagged lines down the board. What's that Sally ?  Well Miss, we were out for a stroll in the forest and suddenly a thunderstorm came up and the lightning struck several trees, and that's what these jagged lines are.  That's very exiting Sally, well done.   \nLastly Bobby goes to the front and draws a single dot on the board. The teacher asks what's exciting about a dot, Bobby?   \nThat's not a dot, Miss, it's a period !   \nWell then, what's exiting about a period ?   \nI don't really know, Miss, but my elder sister has just missed hers and the entire family is excited about it.",

So he goes up to his Dad and says \"Daddy, What is a bastard?\" And his Dad replies \"Oh sweety, it is just another word for gentlemen. Later that day, he goes up to his Mom and says \"Mommy, What is a bitch?\" And his Mom replies \"Honey, it is just another word for women\"\n\n\nTwo days later the kid is sitting downstairs watching television when he hears his parents arguing again, although he still can't hear much, he makes out the words \"Penis\" and \"Vagina\". Not knowing what these words mean, he plans to ask his parents. He decides to ask his Mom first, he walks up to her and says \"Mommy, what is a vagina?\" His Mom, who didn't know what to say, looked around the the first thing she saw was a coat, so she said \"Honey, it is just another word for coat\". Satisfied with that answer, the little kid decides to ask his dad what a \"Penis\" is. So he waks up to his Dad and says \"Daddy, What is a penis?\" His Dad, looks around the room and the first thing he sees is a hat, so he says \"It is just another word for hat\" The little kid satisfied with his answer, leaves and goes back to the television.\n\n\nIt is the morning of thanksgiving and the little kids parents gave him a very important job, to welcome the guests. But, it was still early and no one had arrived yet. All of a sudden he hears his dad scream \"SHIT\". His Dad had cut himself shaving. The little kid runs up to his dad and asks \"What does shit mean?\" And his Dad replies \"It is just a type of shaving cream\". An hour later he hears his Mom yell \"FUCK\", she had cut her finger while she was cutting the turkey. The little kid runs up to his Mom and asks if she is ok and asks \"What does fuck mean?\" His mom says back \"Honey, it is just a way of cutting the turkey\".\n\n\nSo the guests arrive, and the kid goes to welcome them and says in his most gentleman like way, \"Welcome Bitches and Bastards, may I have your penises and vaginas? My Dad is upstairs wiping shit off his face, and my Mom is fucking the turkey.\"",

She walked up to the bartender, and asked,\" May I please use the restroom?\"\n\nThe bartender replied, \"I really don't think you should.\"\n\n\"Why not? \" the nun asked.\n\n\"Well, there is a statue of a naked man in there, and his most private part is covered only by a fig leaf. \"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said the nun, \"I'll just look the other way.\"\n\nSo the bartender showed the nun the door at the top of the stairs, and she proceeded to the restroom.
